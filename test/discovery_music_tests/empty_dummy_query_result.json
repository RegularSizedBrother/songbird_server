      "text": "GLYPH<g1013>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> background music would be when people listened to music passively in social situations or in work for example. They implemented a music inventory specifically designed for that study consisting of 15 items arranged on a 5 point likert type scale. Participants were also asked whether or not they liked or recognized different genres, songs and musicians, on a two point scale of yes or no responses. The genres were adapted from Rentfrow and Goslings (2003) study. The results indicated that the different ways in which people use music is significantly related to their established personality traits. A person\u2019s typical intellectual engagement was significantly related to their music recognition and preference ratings. People with the personality trait of openness were also more likely to listen to music in this cognitive fashion. They also found that people with high neuroticism were more likely to listen to music for emotional and mood regulation, as were people low in extraversion and conscientiousness. Chamorro-Premuzic, Swami, Furnham and Maakip (2009) replicated this study in 2009 with Malysian University students and found again that Neurotic individuals were more likely to use music for emotional regulation. Extraverts were more likely to use music as a background or distraction. People high in the personality trait of openness to experience had a positive relationship with cognitively listening to music. However unlike, their previous study, extraversion was positively, not negatively related to the use of music for emotional regulation and conscientiousness was not linked to emotional regulation. The researchers suggested that the limitations of their studies were a lack of cultural of ethnic diversity and suggested that future research focus on gender differences and how males and females use GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1004>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> music in different ways. For example, they hypothesised that women would use music more for emotional regulation than men. George, Stickle and Rachid (2007), counducted another study that was consistent with the findings of Renfrow and Gosling (2003). He had his sample of 358 canadian college students fill out measures of the BFI and the S.T.O.M.P music preference scale in an effort to replicate parts of Renfrow and Gosling\u2019s study (2003) with a community rather than an undergraduate sample. He too found correlations between the reflective and complex music dimension and openness to experience, as did a preference for intense and rebellious music. The upbeat and conventional music dimension was positively correlated to extraversion and higher levels of conscientiousness. They also discovered that men had a higher preference than women in intense and rebellious music, while women had a higher preference for upbeat and conventional music. Two limitations of this study were that there were a disproportionately large number of University students, which may not be a proper representation of the general population. Furthermore, the sample was from a liberal arts Christian school, which may have skewed the results as they may have had a higher preference for religious music than the general population. Another similar study was undertaken by Desling and Engels (2008), who furthered previous research by using Dutch participants\u2019 for the first time which helped validate and generalize the previous findings (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2007; George et al, 2007; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003).T hey also had their participants redo the survey every year for three years to examine the stability of their music preferences and personality types. Their GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> results revealed that adolescence who enjoyed listening to rock music tended to score relatively low on conscientiousness and quite high on openness to experience, which corresponds to previous research. They also found that participants\u2019 who enjoyed jazz, classical and religious music scored high on the personality facets of conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness to experience, which was also found in Rentrow and Goslings study in 2003. They also found that adolescents who enjoy rap/hip hop had high extraversion and agreeableness scores and similar results were obtained for the pop and dance categories. One distinction between this study and that of Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) was that although similar correlations were found between the music genres and personality types, the correlations in this study were consistently lower. The researchers attributed this to the age difference between the two samples as Renfrow and Goslings study involved college students whereas this study concerned adolescence. They believed that the personality factors of college students may have been more stable than adolescence as peer influences might be more prevalent in the younger sample (Desling & Engels, 2008). An interesting result came about from the retesting of the same participants at year intervals. The researchers discovered that personality factors predicted changes in the music preferences of their participants in between testing\u2019s. Participants who had high levels of openness at the first testing tended to have a decreased music preference for pop and dance music and they also had lower levels of increased preference for rap and urban music. Also, Participants with higher levels of agreeableness tended to have a decreased interest in pop and dance music in subsequent testing\u2019s. Furthermore, adolescence who displayed high levels of extraversion showed a decrease in a preference for Rock music over the span of the three years. GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> The results of this study were valuable because it was the first Dutch sample used and also the first study to follow up with more research on the same participants years later, to see how music preferences and personality change over time. One limitation of this study was that it depended on self- report questionnaires on music preference, which may have been influenced by peer pressure. For example a participant may have enjoyed religious music but would not write it down in case they were deemed uncool by their peers. Zweigenhaft GLYPH<g3> (2008), too looked at the relationship between music preference and personality using the S.T.O.M.P scale developed by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003), however he also looked at individual music genres. Furthermore, he chose to use the NEO-PI rather than the big inventory to assess personality types as it is longer and more complex and has finer gradations between the personality facets. Corresponding with previous research (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), he found a significant positive correlation between peoples liking of reflective and complex music and Openness to experience, which also correlated positively with a preference for intense and rebellious music. His results also echoed Renfrow and Goslings results for the upbeat and conventional music dimension, which correlated with extraversion, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness. Another similarity was found in the relationship between energetic and rhythmic music correlating with extraversion and agreeableness. However this correlation with agreeableness was positively correlated (r=-.07) in Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s study, while it was negatively correlated in Zw eigenhaft \u2019s (2008) study. This investigation also differed from Rentfow and Gosling (2003) as they found a significant positive relationship between openness as the energetic and rhythmic dimension, however this correlation was also found by D esling & Engels (2008). GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> In looking at the music genres separately, Z weigenhaft GLYPH<g3> (2008) discovered that some music genres were more likely to reveal aspects of personality more than other. For instance, folk music which is one of the genres making up the reflective and complex music dimension, correlated with 9 of the personality traits. Conversely, classical music which also falls under the reflective and complex dimension had no significant correlations with any of the personality facets. The researchers concluded that it is important to include the specific music genres as well as the broad music dimensions. Langmeyer et al (2012) were the first researchers to examine the relationship between music preference and personality in a German Population. They administered the Short Test of music Preferences ( Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) and the big five personality inventory to 422 college students ranging from 21 to 26 years of age. Similar to previous studies (Desling & Engels, 2008; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), they found positive correlations between openness to experience and reflective and complex music as well as intense and rebellious music. They further found a negative correlation between openness to experience and upbeat and conventional music. Conscientiousness was found to be weakly correlated to upbeat and conventional music be negatively correlated to the intense and rebellious music dimension, which bears close resemblance to previous research ( D esling & Engels, 2008; George et al., 2007 ; Zweigenhaft, 2008) . They also found that extraversion was positively correlated with upbeat and conventional music as found by D esling & Engels ( 2008) and Rentfrow and Gosling (2003). GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> While Langmeyer et al (2012) succeeded in replicating previous research ( Re ntfrow & Gosling, 2003; George et al, 2007; Desling & Engels, 2008; Zweigenhaft, 2008), with a previously untouched German sample, o ne weakness of the study was that all the correlations found were rather low. This led the researchers to believe that there are other factors at play that affect a person\u2019s music preference other than personality. Another weakness was that there was not much variation in age and the participants were 72% male which may have skewed the results somewhat In a similar study , Chamorro-Premuzic, Fagan and Furnham (2010) tried to determine whether uses of music and personality traits predicted liking of music classified as happy, sad, complex or social. They played the participants 20 unfamiliar music extracts for 30 seconds on a website and they were asked to write down how much they enjoyed the extract on a 5 point likert scale. They also filled out a measure big 5 personality inventory .This study not only replicated the finding of their previous studies, they also found that while peoples liking of sad music tended to increase if they use music in an emotional way, even though emotional stability had no effect on this preference. They further discovered that males liked sad music more than females, although they found no major differences between genders on the emotional use of music, other than females being more likely to experience negative emotions when hearing sad music, which may explain why they enjoy it less than men. Extraversion was positively correlated with happy music and also with their preference for music in the Upbeat and Conventional Music dimension. Openness to experience was positively related to a preference for complex music, although this had no relation to the cognitive use of music. Background music was positively related to a GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1009>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> preference for social and happy music. Males were more likely to enjoy music in a cognitive way and this was negatively correlated with age. In a recent study, Djikic (2011) tested whether music could have an effect on ones experience of their personality traits. Participants filled out a Big five inventory questionnaire and then were divided into three groups. The first group got both the classical music and the lyrics translated into English. The second group, the music only group, heard the Classical music but were only given the lyrics in German. The third were the lyrics only group and heard the song translated in English but did not hear the classical music. Interestingly they found that music enhanced self- reported variability in personality, whereas lyrics seem to supress it. They also found that emotions mediate the effect the lyrics have on personality traits. The researcher believed that showing that music can influence how a person perceives themselves, illustrates the potential of music to open up and change their personality. There have been a number of studies that indirectly explored the link between music and personality also. Barret et al (2010), examined if personality had an effect on music-evoked nostalgia. Their findings suggested that nostalgia proneness was predicted by neuroticism on the big five Inventory. Little and Zuckerman (1986) found a positive correlation between those with a preference for rock music and those high in sensation seeking. Another discovery of theirs was that people high in sensation seeking particularly dislike soundtrack or bland music. They believed that people with this personality type needed to immerse themselves in music rather than use it as a background function and thus GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1010>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> preferred complex music. They also found that people high in experience seeking had wider breadth of music preferences and were more likely to listen to music intensely. A limitation of many previous studies was that they were based solely on undergraduate college students, which are far from a homogenous group and therefore most of the previous research focused on young adults and adolescence. It has been suggested that in order to prove the generalizability of the previous findings, more studies need to be done with a wider age group. Thus one of the aims of the current study was to include people over the age of thirty and to determine whether age differences have an effect on the relationship between music preference and personality type. Previous studies have shown that a person\u2019s personality is much more subject to change during adolescence and early adulthood thanin middle and late adulthood (McCrae et al, 1999; Soto, John, Gosling, 2011; Terracciano, Costa, McCrae, 2006). Moreover, it has been suggested that adolescence is a formative stage in the development of music preference, however this preference may be influenced by their peers how can be very influential in the shaping of adolescence music preferences (Desling & Engels, 2008; Mulder, Ter Boght, Raaijmakers, Gabhainn, Sikkema, 2009). It has also been suggested that the age a person\u2019s music preference crystallises is around 23.5 years and that age correlates positively to music taste consistency (Mulder et al, 2009) and that as people grow older they begin to prefer a certain type of music more (Desling & Engels, 2008). It was therefore hypothesis in the current research that there would a stronger correlation between music preference and personality type in older versus younger participants. The main criticism of previous research on the relationship between music preference and personality was that cultural and environmental influences may influence the results, which could hinder the universalism and generalization of the findings. Most of the previous research was done in the United States so it is unclear the extent to which the findings GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1011>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> generalises to other Countries and cultures. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between personality type and music preference amongst an Irish population sample, which has not been done before. If similar findings were discovered in Ireland as were found in the United states such as Rentfrow and Goslings study in 2003, it would be a good indicator that their finding are not simply due to the culture and environment their participants lived in and could that their results show substantial generalizability across cultures and age groups. Another criticism of previous research is that there were too many facets of personality used and so this current study intents to use a condensed version of the big five personality inventory. The results of this study should contribute to the literature regarding music psychology and further validate the previous studies and lead to better understanding of the topic. This study should be beneficial because it addresses some of the limitations and criticisms of previous research that were mentioned previously. If a correlation is found between music preference and personality, it may be of assistance to Psychologists and Counsellors as it will help them gain a greater insight into their clients personalities and identify and emotional issues or developmental issues they are having and it may also be useful for them as a means of conducting therapy.(White, 1985). It is hypothesised that there will be a relationship between different personality type\u2019s preference for different types of music. It is also hypothesised that there will be a stronger link between music preferences and personality in older rather than young participants. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that there will be a relationship between different personality type\u2019s preference for different types of music. It is further hypothesised that similar to previous research, the complex/reflective and intense/ rebellious music dimension will display a positive relation to the personality trait of openness to experience. The upbeat and conventional music dimension will display a positive correlation with extraversion and conventional/ uncreative and a GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1012>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> negative correlation with openness. And finally it is hypothesised that the energetic and rhythmic music dimension will correlate positively with openness to new experience, extraversion and will negatively correlate with the conventional/ uncreative personality variable. GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g1013>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> CHAPTER TWO: METHOD Materials Participants were supplied with a questionnaire that included a consent form, a demographic information form, a musical preference inventory and a personality inventory. Responses were made by writing in the responses in the spaces provided with a pen. Short Test of Music Preference The music preference inventory utilized was the Short Test of Musical Preferences (STOMP), which was developed by Rentfrow and Gosling in 2003. It was designed to allow researchers to measure music preferences according to the different musical genres. They designed it this was because when most people talk about their musical preferences they do so in terms of genres rather than the individual components that make up the music such as temp, rhythm or melody. In order to come up with their survey, they had to analyse the categories listed on various online music shops. After extensive research they narrowed the list of genres down to 14 basic ones (e.g. blues, rap/hip-hop, country) that they found 97% of their participants were familiar with, as opposed to the 14 genres with 66 subgenres that only 7% of participants were familiar with, which is what they originally found. These genres were then subjected to a principle component analysis allowing them to break the genres down into four factors; intense and rebellious, upbeat and conventional, energetic and rhythmic and reflective and complex. Each genre on the stomp scale is prefaced with, \u201cI like\u201d",

Hypothesis 1 Preliminary analysis were performed on the relationship between the complex and reflective music dimension(as measured by the STOMP) and the Openness personality factor(as measured by the BFI)to test if there was any violations of the assumptions of normality, linearity and homoscedasticity. The complex and reflective music dimension had a significance of under 0.05 in the Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test or normality and Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and a scatterplot revealed that the data was not normally distributed. Therefore a Spearmans Rho was utilized instead of a Pearsons Correlation. Significant associations were observed between the two variables ( rho=2.86, n =109, p<0.05), with higher preference for complex and reflective music associated with higher levels of Openness. Hypothesis 2 Preliminary analyses were performed on the relationship between the upbeat and conventional music dimension and the personality dimension of extraversion. They revealed that the data was not normally distributed and so a Spearmans Rho was the statistical tool used the test the correlation of the two variables. No significant relationship was found, rho=-.006, n=109, p>0.005). For hypothesis 2 the null hypothesis is accepted. GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Hypothesis 3 A Pearsons correlation was carried out to examine the relationship between the intense and rebellious music dimension and the Openness personality facet. . Preliminary analyses were performed to make sure there was no violation of the assumptions of normality, linearity and homoscedasticity. There was a significant association observed between the two variables (r=.262, n 109, p <0.05) Hypothesis 4 The relationship between the Upbeat and conventional music domain and the personality factor of Openness to Experience was investigated using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Preliminary tests of normality revealed that the data was normally distributed. There was no significant correlation found between the variables( r=.113, n = 109, p>0.05). Hypothesis 5 A Spearmans Rho was carried out to find out if there was a relationship between the personality facet of Openness to experience and the music preference dimension of Energetic and rhythmic. Preliminary tests of normality showed that the data was not normally distributed so a Spearman\u2019s Rho was used instead of a Pearsons correlation coefficient. There was a medium positive correlation between the two variables (rho=.197, n=109, p<0.05) with GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> higher preference for energetic and rhythmic music associated with higher levels of Openness to experience. Hypothesis 6 Preliminary tests of normality on the relationship between the energetic and rhythmic music dimension and the personality facet of Extraversion, revealed that the data was not normally distributed. Thus a Spearmans Rho was carried out to see if there was a correlation between the two variables. A significant correlation was observed between the variables (rho=.213,n=109,p<0.05) with a higher musical preference of energetic and rhythmic music moderately associated with higher levels of extraversion. Hypothesis 7 In order to test if there was a stronger relationship between music preference and personality type between older versus younger participants\u2019, a new variable was created with a split file consisting of people over 30 and people under 30. Correlations were then performed between all of the music preference dimensions and all of the personality facets. A Pearsons Correlation coefficient was carried out between the conscientiousness personality facet and the intense and rebellious music dimension and revealed that there was a strong negative significant correlation between the two variables in the over 30 age group ( r=-.496, n=18,p< 0.05), with a lower music preference for intense and rebellious music associated with higher levels of conscientiousness. There was no significant relationship between the same variables in the under 30 age group (r= -.008, n=91, p>.005).",

Six dimensions and 24 facets of personality, and 12 music genres, were assessed. Results indicated that, consistent with much previous research, openness (to experience) and particularly the facet of \u2018\u2018aesthetic appreciation\u2019\u2019 were associated with a preference for \u2018\u2018reflective\u2019\u2019 music (jazz, classical, opera, gospel, enka ), while one extraversion facet (sociability) was associated with the preference for pop music. Other personality dimensions were less consistently associated with musical preferences, pointing to cultural differences and the need to assess both personality and music genres at more specific levels.

GLYPH<C223> 2012 International Union of Psychological Science http://www.psypress.com/ijp http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207594.2011.631544 To the Ancient Greeks, number was the key to the universe, and music was number in audible form. According to Cicero, music is \u2018\u2018a form of communion with divine truth\u2019\u2019 (Reilly, 2001, p. 14). Music in early modern Europe was thought to be \u2018\u2018a conduit for the word of God or a weapon against the Devil\u2019\u2019 (Blanning, 2008, p. 10). Music appears to be no less important an element in most (Blanning, 2008), if not all (D. E. Brown, 2000), contemporary human societies. Researchers are divided as to whether music has survival value (S. Brown, 2000; Miller, 2000), but it is unquestionable that music serves a wide variety of human purposes, mostly based on the simple facts that people enjoy making and hearing music (Huron, 2006; Salimpoor, Benovoy, Larcher, Dagher, & Zatorre, 2011), and appreciate the effects that music can produce (Blanning, 2008; Juslin & Va \u00a8 stfja \u00a8 ll, 2008; Khalfa, Dalla Bella, Roy, Peretz, & Lupien, 2003; North, Hargreaves, & McKendrick, 1999, 2000; Pelletier, 2004; Toomey, 1996). Not surprisingly then, music listening, voluntarily or otherwise, occupies major portions of many people\u2019s daily lives, adolescents in particular (Mehl & Pennebaker, 2003; Tarrant, North, & Hargreaves, 2001), and is instrumental in creating identities and maintaining group cohesion (Abbey & Davis, 2003; Bakagiannis & Tarrant, 2006; Tanner, Asbridge, & Wortley, 2008; Tekman & Hortac\u00b8 su, 2002). This alone makes music a topic of psychological interest. Prior to Rentfrow and Gosling (2003), most if not all studies involved specific music genres and a narrow set of personality traits (see Lamont & Greasley, 2008; Rentfrow & McDonald, 2009, for reviews). In one of the earlier studies, Litle and Zuckerman (1986) found that sensation-seeking (a facet of extraversion) was associated with liking rock music and disliking blander styles among American university students. Dollinger (1993) found associations between extraversion and liking jazz, between sensation seeking and liking hard rock styles, and between openness and liking less \u2018\u2018popular\u2019\u2019 musical styles among American university students. Rawlings and Ciancarelli (1997) found associations between extraversion and liking pop music, and between openness and eclecticism (liking a wider variety of musical styles) among English college students. Subsequently, Rawlings, Barrantes i Vidal, and Furnham (2000) found associations between openness and a taste for complex music (such as jazz) among English and Spanish participants and a positive association between liking hard rock styles and some facets of extraversion. Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) undertook to relate broad-band personality dimensions in the form of the Big Five (openness to experience, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability) to similarly broad-band dimensions of musical genre preference, concurring with Cattell and Anderson (1953, p. 446) that music preferences might reveal important aspects of personality. Rentfrow and Gosling identified four dimensions underlying 14 musical genres that were determined to be generally familiar to American university students (at least in Austin, TX). They labeled them Reflective and Complex (classical, jazz, blues, and folk), Intense and Rebellious (alternative, rock, and metal), Upbeat and Conventional (country, pop, religious, and soundtracks), and Energetic and Rhythmic (rap/hip-hip, soul/funk, and electronica/dance). In the interests of brevity these will henceforth be called Reflective, Intense, Upbeat, and Energetic, respectively. Rentfrow and Gosling found a number of associations between genre preferences and personality dimensions among two large samples of university students. (Correlations are positive unless indicated otherwise.) Liking Upbeat music was correlated with extraversion and agreeableness, and was negatively correlated with openness. Liking Reflective music was correlated with openness and agreeableness. Liking Intense music was correlated with openness and (in one sample only) with agreeableness. Liking Energetic music was correlated with extraversion and agreeableness. Zweingenhaft (2008) found a nearly identical pattern of correlations in a small sample of university students in the Southeastern United States, differing from Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s findings only in that liking Energetic music was negatively rather than positively correlated with agreeableness. George, Stickle, Rachid, and Wopnford (2007) studied the genre preferences of Canadian university students. Their target genres overlapped partially with Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s. They found that students who liked Rebellious music (grunge, metal, punk, alternative, classic rock) and Rhythmic and Intense music (rap/hip-hop, pop, R&B, reggae) were lower in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability, while those who liked Classical were higher in Openness. In a study of Canadian high school students, Miranda and Claes (2008) found that liking Soul (rap/hip-hop, R&B, and reggae) was positively correlated with Extraversion, and that liking Metal, Classical, and many genres (\u2018\u2018eclecticism\u2019\u2019) was correlated with openness. 260 BROWN Additionally, they found that, among girls, liking pop music was correlated with conscientiousness. In a study of Dutch adolescents, Delsing, Ter Bogt, Engels, and Meeus (2008) found that liking Rock music (metal, punk, gothic, rock) was positively correlated with Openness but negatively correlated with conscientiousness. Liking Elite music (jazz, classical, gospel) was positively correlated with conscientiousness and openness but negatively correlated with emotional stability. Liking Urban music (rap/hip-hop, soul/R&B) and dance/pop music (trance/techno, Top 40/Charts) was positively correlated with extraversion and agreeableness. In a study of German college students, Langmeyer, Guglho \u00a8 r-Rudan, and Tarnai (2008), using Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s four genre dimensions, found positive correlations between liking Reflective and Intense music and openness, between liking Upbeat music and conscientiousness, and between liking Energetic music and extraversion. Negative correlations were found between liking Upbeat music and conscientiousness, and liking Intense music and openness. Pimentel and Donnelly (2008) investigated the preferences of Brazilian college students for 20 styles of music, which included most of Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s (2003) genres, along with a number of distinctive Brazilian styles, from which they identified three general dimensions of music genre preferences. They found positive correlations between liking \u2018\u2018Mass Music\u2019\u2019 (sertaneja, pagode, pop, funk, forro\u00b4 , samba, ax _ e, and brega) and extraversion, but a negative correlation with openness. They also found that Refined music (MPB, classical, blues, opera, and jazz) was correlated with openness and negatively correlated with emotionality (neuroticism). Alternative music (rap/hip-hop, metal, punk, reggae, and electronica) was also negatively correlated with emotionality. Rentfrow and Gosling pointed out that a general theory of music preferences requires studies from a wide range of cultures. Chamorro-Premuzic, Swami, Furnham, and Maakip (2009) examined Malaysian university students\u2019 personalities in relation to uses of music, not preferences. The closest to a relevant study of broad-band personality dimensions in relation to music genre preferences is the Pimentel and Donnelly study cited above. The present study is the first to investigate broad dimensions of personality in relation to music preferences in a culture that is unrelated to (albeit not superficially uninfluenced by) Anglo-America\u2013Europe, namely, Japan. In addition, Zweigenhaft\u2019s (2008) results indicated that in some parts of the United States, some music genre preferences reveal personality more perspicuously than others. It is not unreasonable to suspect that such might also be the case in Japan. Thus the present research sought to elucidate the relations between personality (broad-band dimensions as well as more specific facets) and preferences for various music genres in a country that has heretofore been neglected, namely, Japan; thereby contributing to a more universal theory of musical preferences. PRELIMINARY STUDY Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) concluded that music was best studied at the level of genre and subgenre. They selected genres based largely on the music listening habits of North American (and specifically, it seems, Austin, TX) university students. However, as discussed above, researchers have used a variety of different genres appropriate to their samples and accordingly have often found a differing number of factors. Boer (2008), for example, found three factors among nine genres in samples of Brazilian, German, New Zealand, and Philippine students, and four factors in 16 genres among Chinese students. Scha \u00a8 fer and Sedlmeier (2009) found six factors in 25 genres among Germans. It is entirely possible that the listening preferences of Japanese university students cluster in ways unlike those of students in other countries, as their listening experiences and stereotypes associated with various styles undoubtedly differ from those of Americans and others. The music dimensions underlying genres obviously will be influenced by the genres included in the analysis, and the genres that can or should be included depend on the actual listening habits of the target participants. Therefore the primary task at hand was to ascertain what genres participants listen to. To identify the genres of music that Japanese participants are familiar with, 173 students (109 males, 63 females, one unspecified), similar in every respect to those who participated in the main study, were requested to list any musical genre that they liked and listened to. The question format was open-ended and no examples were offered. Only eight genres were listed by two or more participants. Boer (2008) and Scha \u00a8 fer and Sedlmeier (2009), using the same procedure, selected for further analysis genres listed by 75% and 10% of participants, respectively. In the present case, that would have limited the genres to two only (pop and rock), so a less stringent PERSONALITY AND MUSIC 261 criterion was used, namely, any genre mentioned by at least two individuals. These were pop, or specifically \u2018\u2018J-pop\u2019\u2019 ( n \u00bc 83), rock ( n \u00bc 43), jazz ( n \u00bc 9), hip-hop or rap ( n \u00bc 7), metal ( n \u00bc 6), classical ( n \u00bc 6), punk ( n \u00bc 5), and reggae ( n \u00bc 4). In order to achieve a broader level of coverage, additional genres were included, inspired partly by Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s revised \u2018\u2018Short Test of Musical Preferences,\u2019\u2019 and others chosen to reflect indigenous listening habits (based on Kitagawa, 2009; Yano, 1997, 2005, as well as the author\u2019s 17 years of residence in Japan between 1983 and 2011, the fact that they were mentioned by at least one participant described above, and the fact that small local record/CD shops devote precious labeled shelf space to most of them). These were alternative, bluegrass, blues, country, folk, dance, folk, funk, gospel, world, healing ( hiringu , similar to American \u2018\u2018new age\u2019\u2019), opera, religious, soul/R&B, bossa nova, natsumero (roughly, Japanese pop from the 1960s through 1980s), anison (songs for animated cartoons and video games), and enka . These were included on the questionnaire, described below; however, initial analyses indicated that only five of them were familiar to more than half of the participants. The exceptions were gospel, opera, natsumero , anison , and enka . Of these, natsumero and anison were excluded because they are not distinct genres but rather simply older pop songs ( natsumero ) and applications of other genres (mostly rock and pop) as background music to animated cartoons and video games ( anison ). In contrast, enka is a distinct musical style deliberately created by Japanese talent agencies as a commercial alternative to Western pop music and is targeted at, and appeals to, older Japanese (Kitagawa, 2009; Yano, 1997, 2005). It was expected that enka would not be highly correlated with pop, but might be associated with genres that are less identified with youthful listeners, for example, classical or jazz. Consequently, the Main Study questionnaire included the 12 genres of rock, jazz, classical, metal, punk, rap/hip-hop, reggae, enka , opera, gospel, pop, and soul/R & B\u2014those that were familiar to a sizable majority of participants. MAIN STUDY Method Participants Participants were 268 (153 male, 115 female) Japanese college students, attending two universities in the Tokyo area. Although there were some differences between the two groups with regard to personality, these between-group differences were not the focus of the present research, hence data from the two groups were pooled for most analyses. All participants were enrolled in English language classes, which are either compulsory or semielective for all students and do not necessarily indicate a great interest in, or knowledge of, foreign cultures (Hashimoto, 2007). Average age was 19.3 years ( SD \u00bc 1.4). The male average age was slightly higher due to three older males (aged, 24, 27, and 29). Questionnaires were provided for voluntary completion on a \u2018\u2018takehome\u2019\u2019 basis in exchange for bonus class points. There was no overlap in participants between the Preliminary and Main Studies. Instrument Participants indicated how much they liked the target genres on a seven-point response scale ranging from 1 (very much dislike; totemo kirai ) to 7 (very much like; totemo suki ), with a labeled midpoint option (can\u2019t say one way or the other; dochiratomo ienai ). Participants were instructed to indicate with 0 any genres that they were unfamiliar with to minimize the chances that they would simply skip genres out of haste to complete the task. Unfamiliar genres were subsequently treated as missing (not as random) data. Genre names were written in both Japanese and English for the convenience of participants who might be familiar with a genre but not recognize its name in a different language. Finally, participants completed the HEXACO-100 (Ashton & Lee, 2008; Lee & Ashton, 2008). The HEXACO was used in order to investigate more specific aspects of personality that might be associated with preferences for supergenres as well as specific subgenres. The HEXACO model assesses six personality domains (Humility\u2013Honesty, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness), each subsuming four more specific facets . Honesty\u2013Humility subsumes the facets of sincerity, fairness, greed avoidance, and modesty. Emotionality subsumes fearfulness, anxiety, dependence, and sentimentality. Extraversion subsumes social self-esteem, social boldness, sociality, and liveliness. Agreeableness subsumes forgiveness, gentleness, flexibility, and patience. Conscientiousness subsumes organization, diligence, perfectionism, and prudence. Openness to experience subsumes aesthetic appreciation, inquisitiveness, creativity, and unconventionality. A five-point response scale was provided, 262 BROWN which ranged from 1 ( doesn\u2019t apply to me/I don\u2019t think so )to5( applies to me/I think so ). Following procedures outlined by Ashton and Lee (2007), items were summed (after reversing negatively keyed items) to provide scores for each personality domain and facet. The translation used in the present research was provided by Ashton and Lee (personal communication, April 2010). Initial analyses indicated that the six HEXACO subscales had adequate internal consistencies (Cronbach\u2019s a values were: Honesty\u2013Humility \u00bc .76, Emotionality \u00bc .76, Extraversion \u00bc .85, Agreeableness \u00bc .81, Conscientiousness \u00bc .75, and Openness \u00bc .77). Scale intercorrelations were low or nonsignificant, ranging from .20 (between Extraversion and Conscientiousness) to GLYPH<C0> .14 (between Honesty\u2013 Humility and Extraversion). Scale means were reasonably close to the scale midpoint (ranging from 2.97 to 3.40), indicating that scores were not highly skewed. Overall, the psychometric properties of this translation are very similar to those reported for the well-validated Korean version by Boies, Yoo, Ebacher, Lee, and Ashton (2004), and suggest that the Japanese version is adequate for its intended purpose. Results Participants (both males and females) reported spending roughly 10% (1.8 h) of their waking time (17.5 h) listening to music, about the same as American college students (Mehl & Pennebaker, 2003) and English adolescents (Tarrant et al., 2001). This suggests that Japanese college students are about as interested in listening to music as their Western counterparts, and that differences in association are probably not the result of differences in musical interest. Supergenres The 12 genres were submitted to a principal axis factor analysis. The Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues GLYPH<C21> 1.0) with Varimax rotation was applied (Equamax and oblique rotations yielded the same factors with nearly identical factor loadings). The initial analysis yielded four readily interpreted factors, accounting for 53.35% of the variance. However, one factor consisted of a single genre, pop. The analysis was rerun without pop. The same three multigenre factors emerged. Factor loadings are given in Table 1. The first factor consisted of classical, gospel, jazz, opera, and enka , corresponding to Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s Reflective dimension. The second factor consisted of rap/hip-hop, reggae, and soul/R&B, corresponding to Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s Energetic dimension. The third factor consisted of punk, metal, and rock, corresponding to Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s Intense dimension. Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s Upbeat dimension was represented in the present data by the single genre \u2018\u2018pop.\u2019\u2019 Repeating the factor analysis with anison , country, and religious genres included revealed that none of the three genres loaded on the same factor with pop. (Of the three, only country correlated significantly, r (196) \u00bc .17, p < .05, with pop, and that is probably because participants associate country with a single song, which was in fact a pop hit in the USA, namely, \u2018\u2018Take Me Home Country Roads,\u2019\u2019 by John Denver.) As anticipated, enka loaded on the Reflective genre rather than the more youth-oriented genres. It should be noted that identical factor loadings were not expected, as only six of Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s 14 genres were used in the present study (jazz, classical, rap/hip-hop, soul, rock, metal, and pop), while the other six were not used by Rentfrow and Gosling. These however were related in similar ways in the two studies. Cronbach\u2019s a values were .73 for Reflective, .81 for Energetic, and .73 for Intense. Scaled scores were calculated for use in subsequent analyses. Music genre preferences As shown in Table 2, pop was the most generally favored genre and metal the least. Only two genres were rated below the scale midpoint (metal and enka ), and the females rated pop, classical, jazz, TABLE 1 Factor loadings of 11 music genres Music genre preferences 1 2 3 Commonalities Opera .79 .08 .00 .634 Gospel . 61 .22 .04 .416 Classical .58 GLYPH<C0> .14 .10 .359 Jazz .58 .07 .04 .340 Enka . 50 .08 GLYPH<C0> .08 .258 Rap/Hip-hop GLYPH<C0> .07 . 85 .08 .734 Reggae .14 .75 GLYPH<C0> .03 .602 Soul/R&B .18 .70 .12 .551 Metal .05 .02 .82 .492 Punk GLYPH<C0> .03 GLYPH<C0> .02 .71 .710 Rock .05 GLYPH<C0> .02 .58 .342 Factor loadings > .40 are in boldface. PERSONALITY AND MUSIC 263 opera, and to a lesser degree, soul/R&B, gospel, and enka higher than the males did. Personality dimensions and music genre dimensions. At the most general level, the primary finding was that participants higher in openness were more likely to prefer Reflective music, r (165) \u00bc .46, p < .001. Openness was also associated with not liking rap/hip-hop. In addition, participants with higher scores in honesty\u2013humility preferred Reflective music, r (164) \u00bc .21, p < .01. Participants with higher scores in emotionality were significantly more likely to prefer pop, r (165) \u00bc .16, p < .05. Although significant, these last two correlations are modest and may be spurious. No other significant correlations between personality dimensions and musical preferences were found. Personality facets and genre preferences One aim of the present study was to test whether specific personality facets reveal music preferences more than others in Japan, as found by Zweigenhaft (2008) in the (Southeast) United States. Because most of the significant associations, and the largest in the present study involved openness and Reflective music, it seemed reasonable to focus primarily on the openness facets and Reflective genres. All five Reflective genres were associated with aesthetic appreciation, but they differed in the other facets that were involved. Liking classical music was associated with aesthetic appreciation and inquisitiveness, while liking jazz was associated with aesthetic appreciation, creativity, and unconventionality. Classical but not jazz was associated with inquisitiveness; jazz but not opera was associated with unconventionality. Jazz and opera were associated with creativity, but gospel and enka were not, and so on. The pattern of associations is given in Table 3. Concerning facets and specific genres, there were few positive associations, other than those described above involving the openness and Reflective dimensions. Since there were 24 facets and 12 genres, a total of 288 tests were possible, requiring a Bonferroni adjustment to p \u00bc .0017 to maintain a constant p < .05 Type I error rate. At this level there were no significant associations. At the more permissive probability level of p < .05, 11 correlations were significant, but only one appeared to be theoretically meaningful. Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) and Zweigenhaft (2008) found positive correlations between extraversion and Upbeat music. No such association was found in the present data between pop, presumably one of the Upbeat genres, and extraversion. However, an association was found between the extraversion facet of sociability and pop, r (165) \u00bc .22, p < .01. Suggesting that if an association between broad-band personality dimensions and broad-band music genre preferences is not universal, associations between specific personality facets and particular music genres might be (neither Rentfrow & Gosling nor Zweigenhaft examined these more specific possibilities.). Other correlations were also on the small side, ranging from .16 to .23, and did not suggest any general pattern of theoretical relevance. In the interests of brevity they will not be discussed further here (interested readers can contact the author for details, if desired). DISCUSSION The present findings support the hypothesis that musical preferences are related to aspects of personality, and specifically that preferences for TABLE 2 Preference ratings for music genres Overall Males Females Pop 6.03 (1.17) 5.72 (1.22) 6.49 (0.93)*** Rock 5.41 (1.46) 5.36 (1.48) 5.46 (1.45) Classical 5.26 (1.14) 5.03 (1.10) 5.57 (1.13)*** Jazz 5.01 (1.26) 4.71 (1.20) 5.40 (1.23)*** Soul 4.98 (1.43) 4.80 (1.53) 5.21 (1.27)* Rap 4.65 (1.81) 4.69 (1.86) 4.60 (1.75) Gospel 4.57 (1.34) 4.40 (1.27) 4.81 (1.32)* Reggae 4.27 (1.66) 4.25 (1.75) 4.29 (1.55) Punk 4.15 (1.58) 4.29 (1.53) 3.98 (1.63) Opera 4.08 (1.27) 3.76 (1.28) 4.46 (1.15)*** Enka 3.56 (1.32) 3.40 (1.32) 3.77 (1.29)* Metal 3.19 (1.77) 3.31 (1.84) 3.07 (1.62) * p < .05, *** p < .001, independent-sample t -tests between male and female means, two-tailed.

The present results contribute to the existing literature in three ways: first by examining music preferences in relation to more specific personality facets, second by examining personality dimensions as well as facets in relation to specific musical genres, and third by extending the research into a hitherto neglected cultural area, Japan. One association appears to be, if not universal, at least present in every country that has so far been studied, and that is the positive relationship between openness and liking Reflective music. This has been documented in the United States (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003; Zweigenhaft, 2008), Canada (George et al., 2007; Miranda & Claes, 2008), The Netherlands (Delsing et al., 2008), Germany (Langmeyer et al., 2008), Brazil (Pimentel & Donnelly, 2008), among others, and now in the present study, in Japan. Evidence of other associations is sketchier, and depends on part on which specific genres are concerned. Because few of the relevant studies reported information about specific genres (Zweingenhaft, 2008 being one exception), comparisons are difficult. Tentatively and cautiously, it might be noted that the association between extraversion and Upbeat genres found by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) may also occur in Japan, as suggested by the correlation between sociability and pop. We do not know which extraversion facets were associated with which specific Upbeat genres in Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s samples. Closer examination might (or might not) reveal that it is specifically sociability and pop that are associated, rather than other personality facets and other Upbeat genres. Perhaps personality and music genre dimensions are excessively general levels of analysis at which to detect these relationships. Zweigenhaft (2008), for example, found no significant correlations between any of the six Big Five extraversion facets in relation to the general Upbeat genre dimension, but did not look at the particular genres. It remains to be investigated how more specific aspects of personality are related to preferences for particular genres. Again, because different studies have used different genres, and accordingly have found different factors, and have in general not reported genre-specific results, generalization across studies is problematic. Important generalizations may have been missed by focusing on genre dimensions made up of disparate genres that happen to cluster together for mostly unknown reasons. With that caveat in mind, some similarities and differences can be noted. Rentfrow and Gosling (2003), Zweigenhaft (2008), and Langmeyer et al. (2008) all found positive correlations between Energetic music and extraversion. This association was not found in Japan, but there were significant positive correlations between two of the Energetic genres (rap/hip-hop and reggae) and extraversion. Rentfrow and Gosling, and Zweigenhaft, but not Langmeyer et al., found positive correlations between Intense music and openness, while the sole positive significant correlation among the Intense genres in Japan was between openness and rock ( r \u00bc .14, p < .05).

REFLECTIVE, ENERGETIC, and INTENSE are composite scores. PERSONALITY AND MUSIC 265 most and the largest correlations involve either the personality dimension of openness and its facets and the Reflective music dimensions and its genres, or both. CONCLUSION The present research indicates that to a considerable degree the same aspects of personality are associated with similar music preferences in Japan as in the United States, Canada, Holland, Germany, and Brazil, among other countries where less data are available. The present research was limited in aim to delineating patterns of association between major aspects of personality and music genre preferences in Japan. Many questions of course remain to be answered. Mood regulation, for example, is clearly related to music listening choices and may be the primary function of music (Hunter, Schellenberg, & Schimmack, 2010; Juslin & Va \u00a8 stfja \u00a8 ll, 2008). Individuals with particular personality profiles may accordingly have differing needs for mood management. Similarly, individuals use music for a variety of additional purposes. For example, almost all Japanese college students (and some professors) spend several hours per day commuting to and from school on crowded trains and buses, often standing up. Many can be observed listening to music through headphones or earplugs, and informal inquiry suggests that perhaps most student music listening takes place while commuting. It is known that musical preferences interact with time of day and situation (Scha \u00a8 fer & Sedlmeier, 2009). How the stresses of commuting interact with personality to influence music listening choices remains to be investigated. Also, as pointed out by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) and many others (Abbey & Davis, 2003; Bakagiannis & Tarrant, 2006; Delsing et al., 2008; Tanner et al., 2008; Tarrant et al., 2001; Tekman & Hortac\u00b8 su, 2002), music preferences can be used to claim identities and group memberships, as well as advertising one\u2019s personal characteristics (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2006). Music preferences, or at least explicit liking ratings, may be neurologically sensitive to popularity effects (Berns, Capra, Moore, & Noussair, 2010). In addition, preferences may be influenced by factors as prosaic as simple frequency of exposure (Szpunar, Schellenberg, & Pliner, 2004). Participants\u2019 overwhelming preferences for pop and rock (as described above) may indicate limited exposure to a wider variety of musical styles. It is possible that they might prefer different genres if they had more opportunity to hear them. Another possible personality trait, rather more narrow-band than the Big Five (or Six, according to Ashton & Lee, 2007, 2008), that could be considered is musical neophilia (desire for novelty in music experiences). Individuals high in musical neophilia, for example, might gravitate to genres in which extended improvisation or harmonic invention is salient\u2014 jazz and classical, for example\u2014rather than genres where adherence to relatively few successful formulas is more the norm. These questions have not been addressed in the present research but merit investigation. Finally, it should be noted that the present study used the genre listing method, whereby participants indicate how much they like certain genres. This is widely used method, but others are also possible; for example, providing lists of representative songs or artists, or playing music samples. The last two have the advantage of being relatively unambiguous, but the disadvantage of being overly particular\u2014it is difficult to know whether participants are judging the genre, the artist, the song, the arrangement of the song, the particular performance, the situation in which they are listening, or any combination of these. All three methods have the limitation that they abstract music preferences from music listening functions. For example, even within the limited category of \u2018\u2018music for dancing,\u2019\u2019 one could reasonably prefer one genre for one kind of dancing but another genre for another kind of dancing, depending on the situation or one\u2019s interactional or self-presentational objectives. These are issues that need to be addressed in future work.

The stomp scale has been tested extensively by Renfrow and Gosling and used in many other researchers in measuring music preference and has been found to be both valid and reliable(Renfrow& Gosling, 2003;Langmeyer et al 2012; Zweigenhaft, 2008). The Big Five Inventory The Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a self-report inventory that was designed to measure the Big Five personality dimensions (J ohn & Srivastava, 1999). The BFI is a multidimensional personality inventory consisting of 44 items that measure five broad personality domains. Items are measured on a five point scale where 1= disagree strongly and 5=agree strongly. The five broad personality measures include neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and openness to experience. These five traits can give a comprehensive profile of persons behavioural and cognitive patters. Previous studies have shown that this scale has high levels of validity and reliability (John & Soto, 2008; Benet-Martinex & John, 1998). Each personality domain was made up of smaller individual personality components. Extraversion was measured by how quiet, reserved or shy a person was. Neuroticism was made up of how relaxed, emotionally stable and calm a person is in stressful situations. Agreeableness consisted of the degree to which a person tends to find fault with others, starts quarrels with others, can be cold and aloof, and is sometimes rude to others. Conscientiousness was the summation of how careless, disorganized, lazy and easily distracted a person rated themselves. Openness was the results of how they rated how many artistic interests they had and if they preferred work that is routine. GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Consent Form The consent form informed participants the nature of the research, the aim of the study, how long the survey would take to complete if they agree to participate, and what the data will be used for. It also informed them of their right to withdraw at any time and that all data and any information that they give will be kept completely anonymous. Furthermore, it included the researchers contact details and participants were informed that they send an email if they wanted a summary of the results when the study was finished. Demographic Information Form This form included the participants age and gender. Participants A Convenience sample of Psychology students attending Dublin Business School, located in Dublin, Ireland was recruited. A request was made for involvement to all students attending a Psychology class, after being approved by the lecturer. Other Participants were contacted through the social networking site Facebook, and asked to complete an online survey which was implemented by a free online survey website called kwicksurveys.com. The sample GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> consisted of 109 students, 67 males and 42 females. The average age of the participants was 26 (M=26.95, SD=9.25) Design This study employed a prospective, quantitative cross-sectional questionnaires research design. The variables involved were Individuals music genre preferences (blues, country, folk, heavy metal, hip hop, religious, soul, funk, punk, gospel) and Personality traits (Openness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Neuroticism) and Demographic variables(age, gender, nationality). The music factors were the dependant variable and the personality facets and age was the predictor variables. Procedure After permission had been granted from a lecturer in Dublin Business School, the researcher entered the lecture hall, and informed the students present the nature and aims of the study and informed them that participation was totally voluntary and anonymous and they could withdraw at any point. Potential participants were informed that their participation would involve filling out a survey relating to their musical preference and personality type. It was requested that participants answer all items honestly and not to share their answers with anyone. The questionnaires were then distributed and ten minutes allocated for completion. GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> When participants had completed the demographic information form, the Stomp and the BFI , the researcher collected them making sure to keep them all confidential.

The remainder of the data collected for this survey was obtained through the social networking website www.facebook.com, where potential participants were contacted directly and informed of the nature and aim of the research, that participation was completely anonymous and they could withdraw at any time. The online survey distribution was implemented using kwicksurveys.com, which is a free online survey website. In total, 56 online surveys were completed.

Five items from the Big Five Inventory were reverse coded and four items from the Short test of music Preference were coded before analysis. Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics were obtained for all of the four music dimensions (reflective/complex, intense/rebellious, energetic/rhythmic, upbeat and conventional), and the five personality dimensions (openness, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion). The mean scores for the results of the \u201cShort Test for Music Preferences\u201d (S.T.O.M.P), their standard deviations and the average rating (ranking order) for the genres can be found in table 1.

      "text": "GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> A spearmans rho was carried out between the conscientiousness personality facet and the energetic and rhythmic music dimension because preliminary tests of normality revealed that the data was not normally distributed. Once again there was a split file utilized between participants under 30 and participants over 30. There was a strong, negative significant correlation found between the two variables in the over 30 age group (rho=-.707, n=18, p<0.05), with high levels of conscientiousness associated with low levels of music preference for energetic and rhythmic music. There was no significant associations found between the same variables in the under 30 age group ( rho=.103, n=91, p>0.05). A spearmans rho was also carried out to test the relationship between Extraversion and the music preference dimension of energetic and rhythmic. Results revealed that there was a moderate significant positive relationship between the two variables in the under 30 group (rho=.238, n=91,p<0.05) with a higher preference foe energetic and rhythmic music associated with higher levels of extraversion. However, there was no significant relationship between the two variables in the over 30 group (p=-.050, n=28, p>0.05). A Pearsons product-moment correlation coefficient was used to examine if there was an association between the personality facet of Openness the experience and the preference for Intense and Rebellious music. Results displayed a moderate positive correlation between the two variables in the under 30 age group (r=.304,n=91,p<0.05), with higher preference for intense and rebellious music associated with higher levels of openness to experience. There GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> was no significant associations found between the two variables in the over 30 age group however ( r=-.074, n =18, p>0.05.) A Spearmans rho was used to examine the relationship between the Openness to experience personality facet and the preference for reflective and complex music dimension of the S.T.O.M.P. There was a moderate positive, significant correlation found between the two variables in the under 30 age group (rho=.325, n=91, p<0.05). There was no significant relationship found between the two variables in the over 30 age group ( rho=.150, n=18, p>0.05). The findings that there were negative correlations between the older group and the personality trait of conscientiousness and music dimensions intense and rebellious and energetic and rhythmic were not found in previous research. However previous studies have shown that people do become more conscientious as they grow older (Mc Crae et al, 1999; Soto et al 2011 ), and so this could explain why these correlations occurred only in the over thirty age group. While there was a stronger link found between conscientiousness and two music dimensions in the older versus the younger group, there were also stronger correlations found in the younger group between extraversion and energetic and rhythmic music, and openness with music dimensions intense and rebellious and complex and reflective. Thus the hypothesis that there is a stronger relationship between music preference and personality in older rather than younger participants was not supported by the current study as the results are inconclusive. GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1009>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> CHAPTER FOUR: DISCUSSION Summary of Results The results indicated that there was a relationship between music preference and personality type and as seen in previous research, most of the correlations with music preference involved the personality measures of extraversion and openness (Rawlings and Cincarelli, 1997). There were seven hypothesis tested within this research. The first was that there will be a correlation between the personality trait of openness to experience and the complex and reflective music preference dimension, and the second was that there will be a positive correlation between Openness to experience and the intense and rebellious music dimension. Both of these hypotheses were confirmed and accepted by the research. The third hypothesis that the upbeat and conventional music dimension will positively correlate with the personality facet of openness was not supported by the current research. Neither was the fourth hypothesis that there will be a negative correlation between the upbeat and conventional music preference dimension and the personality facet of openness to experience. The fifth and sixth hypothesis was that there will be a positive relationship between the energetic and rhythmic music dimension and the personality facets of openness to experience and extraversion, both of these hypotheses were supported by the results. The final hypothesis was that there will be a stronger relationship between music preferences and personality type in older rather than younger participants. While there was a stronger relationship in two of the correlations, there was also a weaker relationship found in others and so this hypothesis is inconclusive. GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1010>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Reflective/ Complex music preference and Openness to experience The findings of this study supported previous research that there is a positive correlation between people who score high in the openness to experience personality facet and a preference for reflective and complex music (Dollinger, 1993; George et al 2007; Langmeyer et al 2012; Rawlings and Cincarelli, 1997; Rentfrow and gosling 2003;). One explanation for this correlation could be that participants who were open to experiences enjoyed the novelty and originality of the complex and reflective music dimension (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2007). Also as openness to experience has been associated with higher intelligence, it is possible that open individuals might respond more favourably to complex music as they are more likely to understand and appreciate the complicated music techniques being expressed in complex music (Chamorro-Premuzic et al, 2010). Furthermore people who are open to new experiences are more likely to enjoy music with unfamiliar time signatures, melodies and rhythm\u2019s which are characteristics of complex music. Intense and Rebellious music preference and Openness to experience There has been substantial research stating that there is a relationship between the intense and rebellious music dimension and the openness to experience personality measure (Des ling & Engels, 2008; Dollinger, 1993; George et al 2007, Langmeyer et al 2012; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) and this corresponds with the results of the current study. GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1011>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Upbeat and Conventional music preference and Extraversion The current study found no significant relationship between extraversion and a preference for upbeat and conventional music, which diverges from previous research (Des ling & Engels, 2008 , George et al 2007; Rentfrow and gosling 2003; Zweigenhaft, 2008). It is not clear why there was no significant relationship found here but it may have to do with cultural differences, seeing as how none of the previous research was done in Ireland. Upbeat and Conventional music preference and Openness It was hypothesised that there would be a negative correlation between the liking of upbeat and conventional music dimension and the personality trait of openness as found in previous research ( Desling & Engels, 2008; Langmeyer et al 2012; Rawlings & Cincarelli1997, Rentfrow & Gosling 2003; Zweigenhaft, 2008). This too could be due to cross-cultural differences as some of the music genres making up the upbeat and conventional music preference such as country and religious music may not have been as popular in Ireland as they are in America. Energetic an Rhythmic Music and Openness It was hypothesized that there would be a significant positive correlation between participants with a preference for dance/electronica, rap/hip-hop and soul/funk music which make up the energetic and rhythmic music dimension, and the personality measure of Openness to experience. This hypothesis was accepted and the current research supports previous findings GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1012>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> (Desling & Engels, 2008; Rawlings & Cincarelli, 1997; Rentfrow & Gosling 2003; Zweigenhaft, 2008). Energetic and Rhythmic Music and Extraversion Previous research found a correlation between the personality measure extraversion and a preference for energetic and rhythmic music and these findings were replicated in this study which found a significant positive correlation between the variables (rho=.213, n=109,p<0.05). Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) argued that people\u2019s music preferences are selected by how the music reinforces their personal dispositions. This correlation then could be explained by extraverts enjoying energetic and rhythmic music as extraverts have lower resting levels of arousal and higher levels of sensation than introverts and so listening to energetic and rhythmic music might satisfy their needs better than other types of music as it is emotionally arousing music that is fast pace and grabs their attention (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2007, Dollinger, 1993). Difference in older versus younger participants One of the limitations of previous research was that the relationship between music preference and personality may be influenced by other factors such as age and previous researchers have suggested that it would be useful to see if there was a stronger relationship between the two in older versus younger participants\u2019. (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2007 ; Langmeyer et al 2012; , Rentfrow and gosling 2003; Zweigenhaft, 2008). It has been put forth that music preference is already developed by early adolescence and becomes more stable by late adolescence and early adulthood (Holbrook and Schindler, 1989, as cited in Mulder, 2009) and previous studies have shown that age is positively related to music GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g1013>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> preference consistency ( Mulder et al, 2009) . Much of the previous research has focused on the relationship of music preference and personality in teenagers and young adults (Des ling & Engels, 2008; Rawlings & Cincarelli, 1997; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003; Schwartz & Fouts, 2003, Dollinger, 1993; George et al, 2007; Zweigenhaft, 2008 ), and one of the aims of the current research was to extend the findings of the existing research and to apply it to a wider age range and not limit it to college students. Previous research has found a stronger relationship between music preference and personality type in the upbeat and conventional music dimension and the personality factors conscientiousness and agreeableness in participants over thirty (Dean, Yu & Epps, 2007). They speculated that the reason for this may be down to the fact that younger people are still developing and forming their identities as according to the social identity theory (White, 1985). Thus, younger people may be more inclined to listen to music in order to impress people or in order to fit in with their friends, whereas older people who have achieved their identity are more comfortable listening to music for their own benefit without the stress of social approval. This study did not find a significant association between the upbeat and conventional music dimension and the personality factors conscientiousness and agreeableness as previous research did (Dean et al, 2007). However, the current research did find a strong negative correlation between the personality dimension of conscientiousness and the musical dimensions of complex and reflective and intense and rebellious in the over 30 age group, and there was no significant associations of those variables within the under 30 group. This in part supported the hypothesis that there would be a stronger relationship between music preference and personality type, but only in the conscientiousness domain. The under 30 group had a more significant relationship between the personality trait of openness and the reflective and complex music and intense and rebellious music dimensions and also between the personality GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1004>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> trait of openness to experience and energetic and rhythmic. Thus the effect of age on the relationship between music preference and personality type is far from conclusive as there are conflicting relationships between younger and older participants for different variables. Also it must be noted that there were only a small number of participants who took part in this study that were over the age of 30 (n=18). Therefore the hypothesis was rejected. Strengths of the Study One of the main strengths of this study was that it had a large sample size (n=109) and unlike most previous research the participants were not all college students, there was good variation in age and education and occupations. Another strength of the study was that it succeeded to carry on the line of research of studying the relationship between music preference and personality type, which has been chronically understudied this far. This study extends the previous research by using a wider age group and it further validates previous research by using an Irish population for the first time which can add to the validity of previous research. Limitations of the study While a large sample size was obtained for this study, greater variance in the age groups would have given a greater reflection on the impact of age on the relationship between personality and music preference and been able to help generalize findings. The sample was entirely Dublin based which might not be a proper representation of the national population. GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1005>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Due to research constraints, there was only enough time that participants\u2019 were willing to give to answer a survey and so this study comprised of only one personality dimension and music preference scale. If time constraints were not an issue it may have been beneficial to add another scale testing the different ways in which people use music as done in previous research ( Chamorro-Premuzic, 2007; Chamorro-Premuzic, 2010; Re ntfrow & Gosling, 2003) . Furthermore, it would have been useful to include another scale to test individual differences such as cognitive ability as it is possible that there are other predictors of music preference other than personality. Although it is useful to look at statistical evidence based on surveys about music preference and personality, a qualitative approach may be equally if not beneficial. If a researcher interviewed people about their music preference it might yield more significant insights into their personality for example. This study was based on cross-sectional data which means it only can look at correlations but no causations can be obtained from it. It is also impossible to say whether it is a person\u2019s personality that predicts what music they listen to, or if it is the music they listen to that affects their personality. Another limitation was that although the S.T.O.M.P scale has good test-retest reliability, is well researched and does a good job at giving an insight into peoples overall music preferences, the fact that the music preference is broken down into 4 dimensions may not give the full picture of people\u2019s preference. Much music falls into more than one genre or is GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1006>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> hard to categorize which may mean that music preference cannot be put into independent categories. The fact that many artists have different songs which fall into different genres may have affected the results. Future research A suggestion for future research could be to use a completely non-college sample as most of the previous research was done purely of college students. This may help to confirm the generalizability of the results across samples, as there may well be much different results found in a non-college sample as college students tend to be quite up to date with music and their individual cognitive abilities may also have affected results. A less homogenous sample would be well advised for future research. It would also be useful for future research to include another scale for measuring individual differences such as cognitive ability and intelligence because it is likely that these too predispose people to liking certain types of music, along with personality. Most of the previous research between music preference and personality to date has taken a quantitative approach usually administering surveys and questionnaires in relation to the variables. However as mentioned previously, using a qualitative approach such as interviews may lead to greater insights and future researchers may look into this too. GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1007>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> One could also further look into the different uses and ways in which people use music, because there have been limited studies on this to date, and there have not been enough studies outside of America to test the generalizability of the results. It seems that there may also be significant benefits from future research who break down the music dimensions into less restrictive genres, as new genres are created all the time, and most artists fall into more than one genre and as music is such a dynamic art form there needs to be a way to keep up with the changes when assessing music preference. It may be useful for future researchers to first ask participants\u2019 if they agree with certain music genres falling into each dimension of the S.T.O.M.P as if they don\u2019t it will affect the validity of the results.( Zweigenhaft, 2008). There has been limited research looking at the effect of age on music preference and personality, especially in adults over 30. Future research would do well to focus on a wider range of age groups as it could yield interesting results about how people\u2019s personality and music preference evolve over their lifespan. Most of the previous research was based on a once off sample and to this researchers knowledge there are no longitudinal or cross sectional studies, that too could give insights on how a person\u2019s personality and music preference change over time and could help to further explain how the two variables interact.",

NORTH Heriot Watt University Several studies have investigated the relationship between (usually a narrow set of) personality dimensions and liking for a small number of individual musical styles. To date there has been no attempt to investigate, within a single methodology, the extent to which personality factors correlate with liking for a very wide range of musical styles. To address this, 36,518 partici-pants rated their liking for 104 musical styles, completed a short form of the Big 5 personality inventory, and provided other data about their favorite musical styles. Personality factors were related to both liking for the musical styles and participants\u2019 reasons for listening to this music. However, on the whole these latter variables were related more closely to participants\u2019 age, sex, and income than to Big 5 scores. Thus, personality is related to musical taste, but other individual differences are arguably related more closely. Research has characterized aesthetic responses to music as mediated by aspects of the music itself, the listening situation, and the listener (e.g., North & Hargreaves, 2008). Studies of the aspects of the music itself that influence musical preference have focused on the complexity and familiarity of the mu sic or the extent to which it is typical of that to which participants are usually exposed (e.g., Martindale & Moore, 1989). Research on the listening situation has investigated how listeners use music to mediate arousal in the autonomic nervous system caused by those situations (Konec\u02c7ni, 1982; North & Hargreaves, 2000) or to meet a series of mundane, everyday goals (North, Hargreaves, & Hargreaves, 2004; Sloboda, O\u2019Neill, & Ivaldi, 2001). Research on the third factor, the listener, is scarce, however. Arguably the most frequently studied individual difference factor in mu sical taste is personality, and research has focused strongly on factors that distinguish fans of both rap and rock from the rest of the population, such as Zuckerman\u2019s (1979) sensation-seeking scale (Arnett, 1991, 1992; Hall, 2005), conservatism variables (Glas gow & Cartier, 1985; Lynxwiler & Gay, 2000), and anti-authoritarianism (North & Hargreaves, 2006; Wingood et al., 2003). Note, however, that the rebellious nature of rock fans is not found universally (Zweigenhaft, 2008) and that George, Stickle, Rachid, and Wopnford (2007) American Journal of Psychology Summer 2010, Vol. 123, No. 2 pp. 199\u2013208 \u2022 \u00a9 2010 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois This content downloaded from 65.60.222.71 on Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:06:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms and Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) found that rap and rock load onto differing groupings of musical taste and so must be treated separately. Moreover, this focus on antiauthoritarianism among rap and rock fans has two implications. First, little is known about whether personality in general is related to musical taste in general, with perhaps only two attempts to investigate this question to date. Rentfrow and Gos ling (2003) first identified four musical metastyles: reflective and complex, intense and rebellious, up beat and conventional, and energetic and rhythmic, which were associated with scores on the Big Five personality inventory (see Langford, 2003), which produces a score for an individual on each of five dimensions that together are claimed to provide a comprehensive overview of personality. The Big Five dimensions are openness, conscientiousness, extro version, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Openness is an appreciation of adventurousness and art, curios ity, and enjoyment of the unusual; conscientiousness consists of self-discipline, feelings of duty, planning, and achievement orientation; extroversion consists of seeking stimulation and company, energy, and sur gency; agreeableness consists of being compassion ate and cooperative; and neuroticism is emotional instability and a predisposition toward negative emo tions such as anxiety and depression. For example, Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) found that liking for both reflective and complex music and intense and rebellious music was related positively to openness; that liking for upbeat and conventional music was related positively to extroversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness and negatively to openness; and that liking for energetic and rhythmic music was re lated positively to extroversion and agreeableness. Similarly, George et al. (2007) assessed liking for 30 musical styles among 358 people and studied how this related to the Big Five personality dimensions plus several other individual difference variables: in telligence, spirituality, self-esteem, social skills, locus of control, emotional stability, hostility, and depres sion. They found that \u201cfactor analysis of the 30 music styles resulted in 8 factors .\u202f.\u202f. [and that there was] an almost comprehensively negative personal profile for those who listen to the Rebellious and Rhythmic & Intense categories of music. Results further produce an almost comprehensively positive profile for those who listen to Classical music\u201d (p. 32). Second, another consequence of the focus on anti-authoritarianism among fans of rap and rock is that little is known about the extent to which more general aspects of personality are related to liking for a range of musical styles. The correlations between liking for metastyles and scores on the Big Five di mensions identified by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) were typically between .10 and .25, indicating that they explained far less than 10% of the variance in participants\u2019 data. The possibility exists that although a general measure of personality is related to liking for a wide range of musical styles, any such relationships might be small. To address these two issues, this article presents regression data based on an Internet survey of more than 36,000 people concerning the extent to which their degree of liking for 104 different musical styles could be predicted by their scores on a short measure of the Big Five personality inventory. The main hy pothesis of the present research was that participants\u2019 liking for these musical styles should be related to their personality. Other Individual Difference Variables: Self-Esteem, Age, Sex, and Income Research suggests that several aspects of the listener other than personality might also be related to musi cal taste. Therefore, the second aim of the present research was to compare the strength of the relation ship between musical taste and personality with rela tionships between musical taste and self-esteem, age, sex, and income. First, the research investigated whether selfes teem was related to liking for the musical styles. This question was considered because of research showing elevated levels of selfharming and lower self-esteem among rock fans (e.g., North & Hargreaves, 2006; Rubin, West, & Mitchell, 2001) and Tarrant, North, and Hargreaves\u2019s (2002) finding that the maintenance of self-esteem underlies the use of musical preference in intergroup discrimination. Second, the role of age in musical tastes has been studied surprisingly little, but Hargreaves and Castell (1987) reported evidence supporting their contention that age should be related positively to liking for more complex music; other studies implicate adolescence as a critical period in the development of musical taste (Holbrook & Schin dler, 1989; North & Hargreaves, 1995, 2002). Third, 200\u2003 \u2022\u2003 north This content downloaded from 65.60.222.71 on Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:06:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms few studies have addressed sex as the primary source of variation in musical taste, although there is some indication that women prefer \u201csofter\u201d musical styles such as mainstream pop, whereas men tend to prefer \u201charder\u201d styles such as rock (see North, Hargreaves, & O\u2019Neill, 2000). Finally, there is some indication from sociological research drawing on a Marxist ap proach that higher income is associated with taste for \u201chigh art\u201d musical styles (see Shepherd, 2003; North & Hargreaves, 2007). Reasons for Listening to Favorite Musical Style The present research also allowed investigation of an interesting subsidiary issue concerning individual differences in musical taste. As noted earlier, several studies have found that people whose favorite musi cal style is rap or rock score higher than others on various measures of anti-authoritarianism. Implicit in these studies is the notion that the sensational lyrics and musical characteristics associated with the mu sic reflect the dispositions of the listeners. More for mally, this suggests that favorite musical styles might reflect aspects of personality: The characteristics of a person\u2019s favorite musical style might correspond with an exaggerated personality disposition held by that person. However, data concerning a much wider range of musical styles are needed before such a con clusion can be stated with confidence. In particular, an alternative possibility is that people might instead have as their favorite a musical style that compensates for, or attenuates, an otherwise exaggerated personal ity trait. Study Method Participants Data were collected via an Internet questionnaire (in English) that was publicized by the host university\u2019s Web site and a press release targeted at newspapers and radio stations situated in Europe, North Amer ica, Australia, and New Zealand. The press release noted that an attempt was being made \u201cto carry out the largest-ever academic study of musical taste,\u201d that the intention was to collect data from a large number of respondents, and that as many people as possible were needed to visit the project Web site in order to complete an online questionnaire presented there. Data from 1,336 respondents (3.5% of all respon dents) were discarded because the participants did not live in the target areas. Data was deleted from another 66 respondents who did not state their age or country of origin. Data were deleted from 5 other respondents who failed to select the \u201cunknown\u201d op tion for a fictional musical style included on the list, \u201cpancat,\u201d which was included to identify participants producing unreliable data. This left a final sample of 36,518 participants with a mean age of 28.13 years ( SD = 10.47), comprising 22,163 men and 14,355 women, with 24,792 from Europe (principally Den mark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, and the United Kingdom), 10,223 from North America, and 1,503 from Australia and New Zealand. Respon dents\u2019 Internet Protocol addresses were used to verify that they did not complete the questionnaire twice. A researcher was available via phone and e-mail dur ing data collection to answer participants\u2019 questions and prevent dropouts. A region (Europe vs. North America vs. Australasia)\u202f\u00d7\u202fgender multivariate analy sis of covariance ( mancova ) (which treated income and age as covariates) was carried out on factor scores resulting from the principal component analysis of ratings of liking for the musical styles (Table 1); this indicated no effect of region when these other fac tors were accounted for, so data from Europe, North America, and Australasia were pooled in the analyses reported here. Questionnaire Participants stated their age in years, their sex (with 1 = male , 2 = female ), and their total personal annual income before tax and then completed the Rosen berg self-esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1989), on which high scores indicate high self-esteem (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .87). The most thorough assessment of the Big Five was provided by Costa and McCrae\u2019s (1985) 240 item NEO Personality Inventory. However, its length clearly makes it unsuitable for use in research that also requires data collection for a second factor, in this case musical preferences. Participants therefore completed Langford\u2019s (2003) five-item measure of the Big Five personality dimensions. Langford inves tigated the validity and reliability of several shorter versions of Shafer\u2019s (1999) 30 item measure of the Big Five and concluded that there was \u201conly a slight decline in predictive validity as the number of items and adjectives in the Big Five measures decreased. The results support the use of the abridged measures individual differences in musical taste \u2022\u2003 201 This content downloaded from 65.60.222.71 on Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:06:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Table 1.

The resulting five-item measure produced by Langford requires participants to rate themselves on 7 point proxy scales for the Big Five dimensions of openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, which are respectively \u201cuncreative\u2013creative,\u201d \u201clazy\u2013hard working,\u201d \u201cshy\u2013outgoing,\u201d \u201cheadstrong\u2013 gentle,\u201d and \u201cnervous\u2013at ease.\u201d The items selected by Langford for this five-item measure were those that showed the highest weighted average factor loadings across Shafer\u2019s published studies, and scores on these five items produced correlations with scores on a 30 item measure of the Big Five dimensions between .69 and .82 (mean = .76). Note that although the five items used here are appropriate proxies for the Big Five dimensions, the manuscript hereafter refers only to the five items themselves, for the sake of accuracy. Similarly, note that the conclusions reached must be taken as being in relation to the five items themselves and that the relationship between these conclusions and the Big Five dimensions per se is potentially more open to debate. Participants then rated their liking for 104 musi cal styles, presented alphabetically, from 0 ( dislike a lot ) to 10 ( like a lot ). Participants were also told, \u201cIf you have never heard of a musical style, or you don\u2019t recognise it, then please select \u2018unknown\u2019\u201d instead of giving a rating. In an attempt to investigate the widest possible range of musical styles, the 104 styles were from all global regions, selected in consultation with an ethnomusicologist and checked with the relevant cultural groups (e.g., via cultural centers, Internet chat rooms, and student societies) to ensure that they were well known. Participants were next presented with the full list of musical styles and asked to nominate one as their favorite; 10 statements from North, Hargreaves, and O\u2019Neill (2000) and asked to rate the extent to which each was a reason why they listened to their favorite style of music (0 = definitely not a reason, 10 = defi-nitely a reason ); and nine emotional terms from North and Hargreaves (1997) on which they rated how their favorite style of music usually makes them feel (0 = not at all true for me, 10 = really true for me ). In addition to the rating of how arousing the music was (see Berlyne, 1971; Russell, 1978), the remaining eight emotional terms represented two from each of the four quadrants of the circumplex approach to emotion. Participants also rated four reasons (from North & Oishi, 2006) why they might buy music within their favorite musical style (0 = definitely not a reason, 10 = definitely is a reason ). Results and Discussion Many of the non-Western musical styles were not rec ognized by a large portion of the participants, with implications for the statistical power and degrees of freedom of further analyses, so 51 musical styles that were not recognized by at least 60% the participants were deleted from the dataset. A list of these can be downloaded from the author\u2019s Web page (http:// www.psychology.hw.ac.uk/staff.php). Metastyles A principal component analysis was carried out on ratings of liking for the remaining musical styles. Vari max rotation yielded 10 components with eigenvalues greater than one (see Table 1), with these metastyles being labeled classical music, jazz, mainstream, folk, alternative rock, Latino, music of black origin (MOBO), dance, rock, and functional . Musical Taste and Individual Differences Multiple regressions investigated the extent to which personality, self-esteem, age, sex, and income could predict liking for each separate musical style. The full results for each unique musical style are available from the author\u2019s Web site, which shows that liking for each was predicted significantly by the individual difference variables and by at least one of the person ality variables. However, in a dataset as large as that here, indicators of the actual strength of association other than statistical significance are arguably more insightful. Accordingly, Table 2 presents two ver sions of the mean standardized beta values for each metastyle. In the calculation of the first set of mean beta values (designated \u201cStrength\u201d), the direction of the individual values was ignored, indicating the overall strength of association. The second set of mean beta values (designated \u201cDirection\u201d) included the direction of the values in calculating the mean. Table 2 shows that the predictor variables explained only a small proportion (typically between 2% and 5%) of the variance in musical taste. Individual dif ferences were related only weakly to musical prefer ence, and age alone explained the greatest portion of the relationship. Indeed, the grand mean row in Table 2 for strength indicates that the variables most closely related to mu sical taste were, in descending order, age, gender, in come, \u201ccreative,\u201d \u201coutgoing,\u201d \u201cself-esteem,\u201d \u201cgentle,\u201d \u201chardworking,\u201d and \u201cat ease.\u201d Of the five personality dimensions, scores for \u201ccreative\u201d were related most closely to musical taste. Creative was the proxy term for the openness dimension of the Big Five. The latter subsumes concepts such as being creative, imagina tive, and artistic, and so it is unsurprising that the term representing this scale in the present research is more closely related to musical taste than others. Although the beta values in Table 2 are small, which undoubtedly tempers the strength of any broader conclusions about the specific direction of the findings, it is also interesting to compare the present data with those from earlier studies that have concluded that people who like both rap and rock music hold antiauthoritarian attitudes and that people who like classical music hold more conserva tive attitudes. The \u201cDirection\u201d rows of Table 2 indi cate that when used to predict liking for the MOBO metastyle, \u201cgentle\u201d (the proxy for the agreeableness dimension) gave rise to a mean standardized beta value of just .001; this fails to support the findings of previous studies suggesting a reasonably strong posi tive relationship between antiauthoritarianism and liking for such music. Similarly, the rock metastyle was associated with a mean standardized beta value of .006 for \u201cgentle,\u201d which is also arguably incon sistent with a rebellious worldview (and consistent with Zweigenhaft\u2019s, 2008, conclusion that rock fans are not necessarily rebellious). Similarly, the classi cal music metastyle was associated with the highest score for \u201ccreative\u201d (the proxy for the \u201copenness\u201d dimension), which is arguably inconsistent with a conservative worldview and more consistent with a liberal one; many measures of conservatism (e.g., Wilson, 1975) have interest in the arts contributing negatively. It is also interesting that the strength of the pres ent relationships was lower than identified by George Table 2.

(2007), who reported r 2 values ranging between .092 and .311, although Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) reported correlations of similar magnitude to those identified here. Moreover, providing we make a few assumptions about the similarity of the metastyles identified in these datasets, some interesting simi larities and dissimilarities emerge in terms of their relationships with personality dimensions. For in stance, Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s \u201creflective and com plex\u201d metastyle maps onto the metastyles here for jazz, classical music, and folk. In apparent support of Rentfrow and Gosling\u2019s findings, these styles were among those most closely related to \u201ccreative\u201d scores. However, Rentfrow and Gosling also found that openness was related to liking for their \u201cintense and rebellious\u201d metastyle. In contrast, Table 2 shows that \u201ccreative\u201d scores (the proxy here for openness) were not closely related to liking for the rock (and dance) metastyles. Similarly, Rentfrow and Gosling found that liking for their \u201cupbeat and convention al\u201d metastyle was related positively to extroversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Some aspects of Table 2 support this, such as the strong relation ship between \u201cgentle\u201d (the proxy here for agreeable ness) and liking for mainstream music. However, the mainstream metastyle was also among those related most weakly to the measure of \u201coutgoing\u201d (i.e., the proxy for extroversion). Moreover, arguably the most conventional metastyle of all those identified in Table 2, functional music, was no more closely related to \u201cgentle\u201d (i.e., the proxy for agreeableness) scores than were many other metastyles. George et al.\u2019s (2007) dataset yielded metastyles quite different from those identified here, which ham pers comparison, although there is clear overlap be tween George et al.\u2019s \u201crebellious\u201d metastyle and the alternative rock and rock metastyles here, and also between the classical and jazz (or \u201cjazz and blues,\u201d as George et al. called it) metastyles identified by both studies. It is interesting that George et al. found a similar pattern for classical music to that identified here and a similar pattern for rebellious music to that here for alternative rock and rock. With regard to jazz and blues, George et al. found a positive relationship with openness, which mirrors the finding here for \u201ccreative\u201d scores, but a negative relationship with agreeableness that does not mirror that found here for \u201cgentle\u201d scores. The differences between the present results and those of both George et al. and also Rentfrow and Gosling could be attributable to differences in methods, most notably the use of a shorter measure of personality here. Another possibility may be dif ferences between the respective samples according to four other factors that the present research identi fied as also related to musical taste, namely age, sex, income, and self-esteem. Because age and gender, in particular, explained a greater portion of the variance in musical taste within the current dataset than did personality, it is worthwhile considering these \u201cnon personality\u201d individual differences in more detail. Table 2 shows that negative relationships existed between age and liking for the MOBO, dance, alter native rock, and rock metastyles, whereas positive relationships were found for the classical, jazz, main stream, folk, Latino, and functional metastyles. This is broadly consistent with previous research suggest ing that age is associated positively with liking for more musically complex styles. Table 2 shows that men demonstrated higher degrees of liking for the jazz, dance, rock, and functional metastyles, whereas women demonstrated higher liking for the classi cal, mainstream, folk, alternative rock, Latino, and MOBO metastyles. This provides some support for the prediction that women should prefer \u201csofter\u201d musical styles, although women\u2019s liking for alterna tive rock and MOBO is more difficult to reconcile with such a conclusion. Although income was related to liking for the majority of the musical styles consid ered, this was not in the predicted direction: Table 2 indicates that there were negative relationships between income and liking for the classical and jazz metastyles, among several others, even though these represent the most \u201chigh art\u201d of the styles consid ered, whereas the metastyle giving rise to the stron gest positive relationship with income was dance. It is difficult to explain such a pattern of findings in terms of previous research. Finally, Table 2 indi cates that selfesteem was related negatively to liking for the alternative rock metastyle, consistent with previous research. Also interesting in this context, however, is that self-esteem was related positively to liking for the MOBO and rock metastyles, even though these styles have been criticized regularly by various protest groups and legislators for having a supposedly negative influence on young people. individual differences in musical taste \u2022\u2003 205 This content downloaded from 65.60.222.71 on Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:06:01 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Reasons for Listening to Favorite Musical Style Another set of multiple regressions investigated the extent to which the predictor variables could explain participants\u2019 ratings of 10 reasons why they listen to their favorite style of music. The results of these 10 re gressions are reported in Table 3. These data indicate that men were more likely to report listening to their favorite musical style in order to be creative and use imagination, to create an image for themselves, and to please friends. In contrast, women were more likely to report listening to their favorite musical style because of enjoyment, to relieve boredom, to help get through difficult times, to relieve tension, to express feelings and emotions, and to reduce loneliness. These sex differences are consistent with predictions and sup port the findings of North et al. (2000). Table 3 also indicates numerous associations between ratings of the reasons for listening to the participants\u2019 favorite musical style and scores on the personality dimensions. Within these are several as sociations that provide some support for the notion that reasons for listening represent a reflection rath er than a compensation for personality. \u201cCreative\u201d scores (the proxy for openness) were related posi tively to listening to music in order to enjoy the music, to be creative and use imagination, and to express feelings and emotions. \u201cOutgoing\u201d scores (the proxy for extroversion) were related positively to listening to music in order to be trendy, to create an image, and to please friends, and they were related negatively to listening to music in order to reduce loneliness. \u201cGentle\u201d scores (the proxy for agreeableness) were related positively to listening to music in order to be creative and use imagination, to manage emotions, and to please friends. \u201cAt ease\u201d scores (the proxy for neuroticism) were related negatively to listening to music in order to get through difficult times, relieve tension, and reduce loneliness.

Ratings of self-esteem were related positively to lis tening to music in order to enjoy the music, whereas ratings of self-esteem were related negatively to listen ing to music in order to relieve boredom, get through difficult times, be trendy, relieve tension, create an image, express feeling and emotions, please friends, and reduce loneliness. No hypotheses were made about relationships between reasons for listening to the favorite musical style and both age and income. However, it is interest ing that Table 3 shows that age was related negatively to all the reasons for listening. A lack of prior research makes it difficult to interpret this, but one interesting possibility is simply that, with age, people become less prone to using music to achieve goals and address problems that they face. Perhaps instead older people use other sources of support, such as relationships with other people. Finally, it should be noted that three other sets of subsidiary analyses are available on the author\u2019s Web site. These report the emotional reactions typically induced by the participant\u2019s favorite musical style, the reasons why participants typically bought music, and the means by which participants typically bought music. Although these yielded statistically significant data, the portion of the variance explained was small, and so these analyses are not reported here. Conclusion This study found that liking for a wide range of musi cal styles could be grouped into 10 metastyles, that liking for the musical styles was related to a short form of a general measure of personality, that other individual differences (particularly age) appear to be related to musical taste more closely than were data obtained from the short personality measure, and that participants\u2019 reasons for listening to their favorite mu sic typically reflected (rather than compensated for) aspects of their personality. However, even though individual difference variables typically explained only a small portion of the variance in musical taste, this does not mean that individual differences are un important or uninteresting. Without consideration of them, it would be difficult to explain the diversity of musical tastes that exist. Moreover, Table 2 indi cates that the importance of individual differences varies widely between musical styles; it is more ap propriate to consider the former on a style-by-style and variable-byvariable basis. More generally, the wideranging pattern of relationships identified here suggests that they deserve more attention than has hitherto been afforded them.

      "text": "MUSIC PREFERENCES 1247 Figure 7. General attributes of each of the music-preference dimensions. Summary Overall, the judges\u2019 ratings of the 140 songs shed light on the underlying attributes that bind music genres together. In addition, they suggest that the dimension labels we chose in Study 2 char-acterize each dimension quite well. Analyses of the music attributes paint rather interesting and unique pictures of each dimen-sion. Whereas the Reflective and Complex dimension projects a broad spectrum of both positive and negative emotions that is quite complex in structure, the Intense and Rebellious dimension displays moderately complex structure and intense negative emotions. The Upbeat and Conventional dimension expresses predominantly positive emotions, is simple in structure, and is moderately ener-getic, whereas the Energetic and Rhythmic dimension exhibits comparatively less positive and negative emotion, is moderately energetic, and tends to place greater emphasis on rhythm. Study 6: Examining the Relationship Between Music Preferences and Personality In Studies 2\u2013 4, we identified four dimensions of music prefer-ences that generalized across time, populations, methods, and geographic region. In Study 5, we characterized each dimension in terms of a variety of different music attributes. Having identified and characterized the music-preference dimensions, we could ad-dress a central question underlying this research: How are music preferences related to existing personality characteristics? Method Participants. To examine the external correlates of the four music-preference dimensions, we administered a number of tests of personality, self-views, and cognitive ability to a sample of college students. Partici-pants were from Studies 2 and 3 and the retest subsample from Study 2 ( N s 1,704, 1,383, and 118, respectively). In both Studies 2 and 3 (S2 and S3), participants completed measures of personality and selfviews, and participants in the retest subsample (SS2) completed a test of cognitive ability. Measures of personality. Personality was assessed with a variety of measures. To assess personality at a broad level, we included the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John & Srivastava, 1999). The BFI consists of 44 items that tap five broad personality domains. Items were rated on a 5point scale with endpoints at 1 ( Disagree strongly ) and 5 ( Agree strongly ). The Personality Research Form\u2014Dominance (Jackson, 1974) was ad-ministered as a measure of interpersonal dominance strivings. Using a true\u2013false response format, participants indicated their agreement with 16 statements. We included the Social Dominance Orientation Scale (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994). This questionnaire consists of 14 items, which tap individual differences in orientation to socially conservative ideals and attitudes. Participants were asked to indicate their feeling toward each statement using a 7-point Likert-type scale with endpoints at 1 ( Very negative ) and 7 ( Very positive ). The Brief Loquaciousness and Interpersonal Responsiveness Test (Swann & Rentfrow, 2001) was administered to assess individual differ-ences in interpersonal communication styles. Specifically, this test discrim-inates between individuals who tend to express their thoughts and feelings as soon as they come to mind ( blirtatious [from the acronym for the test, BLIRT] individuals) and individuals who tend to keep their thoughts to themselves ( nonblirtatious individuals). Participants indicated the extent to which they agreed with eight items using a 5-point scale with endpoints at 1 ( Strongly disagree ) and 5 ( Strongly agree ). Self-esteem was assessed with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosen-berg, 1965). This is a widely used measure of self-esteem and consists of 10 statements. Participants were asked to indicate, using a 5-point 1248 RENTFROW AND GOSLING Figure 8. Lyric attributes of each of the music-preference dimensions. Likert-type scale with endpoints at 1 ( Not at all ) and 5 ( Extremely ) the extent to which each statement was characteristic of themselves. The Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, 1972) was included as a measure of depression. This test assesses individual differences in depression and captures the degree to which individuals have experienced depressive thoughts and feelings during the preceding week. Participants responded to 13 items, each with four statements, and indicated which statement best described their feelings over the past week. Self-views. We were also interested in how individuals\u2019 self-views relate to their music preferences. Using a 5point Likert-type scale with endpoints at 1 ( Disagree strongly ) and 5 ( Agree strongly ), participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they saw themselves as politi-cally liberal, politically conservative, physically attractive, wealthy, ath-letic, and intelligent. Cognitive ability. The Wonderlic IQ Test (Wonderlic, 1977) was ad-ministered as a measure of verbal and analytic reasoning ability. The test includes 50 items, and participants were given 12 min to complete as many items as possible. Research among college samples has found that the test is predictive of college grades (McKelvie, 1989) and ratings of self-perceived intelligence (Paulhus, Lysy, & Yik, 1998). Results and Discussion To examine the relationship between music preferences and personality, scale scores on each of the four dimensions were computed. We then computed correlations between the musicpreference dimensions and scores on the measures of personality, self-views, and cognitive ability. The patterns of correlations be-tween the music-preference dimensions and the external correlates are shown in Table 3. 4 The correlations presented in Table 3 reveal a fascinating pat-tern of links between music preferences and personality, self-views, and cognitive ability. For example, the Reflective and Complex dimension was positively related to Openness to New Experiences, self-perceived intelligence, verbal (but not analytic) ability, and political liberalism and negatively related to social dominance orientation and athleticism. These correlations, along with item-level analyses of the BFI, suggest that individuals who enjoy listening to reflective and complex music tend to be inven-tive, have active imaginations, value aesthetic experiences, con-sider themselves to be intelligent, tolerant of others, and reject conservative ideals. 4Research with musicians has suggested that men and women prefer to play different musical instruments (Dibben, 2002; O\u2019Neill, 1997; O\u2019Neill & Boulton, 1996), so it is reasonable to suppose that the relationships between music preferences and personality could be moderated by sex. However, when correlations between music preferences and personality were computed separately for men and women, the magnitude and pattern of the correlations were virtually identical for both sexes. Thus, the correlations presented in Table 3 include both men and women. MUSIC PREFERENCES 1249 Figure 9. Music attributes of each of the music-preference dimensions. The Intense and Rebellious dimension was positively related to Openness to New Experiences, athleticism, self-perceived intelli-gence, and verbal ability. Interestingly, despite previous findings that this dimension contains music that emphasizes negative emo-tions, individuals who prefer music in this dimension do not appear to display signs of neuroticism or disagreeableness. Overall, individuals who prefer intense and rebellious music tend to be curious about different things, enjoy taking risks, are physically active, and consider themselves intelligent. The external correlates of the Upbeat and Conventional dimen-sion reveal positive correlations with Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, conservatism, self-perceived physical attrac-tiveness, and athleticism and negative correlations with Openness to New Experiences, social dominance orientation, liberalism, and verbal ability. Our analyses suggest that individuals who enjoy listening to upbeat and conventional music are cheerful, socially outgoing, reliable, enjoy helping others, see themselves as physically attractive, and tend to be relatively conventional. The Energetic and Rhythmic dimension was positively related to Extraversion, Agreeableness, blirtatiousness, liberalism, self-perceived attractiveness, and athleticism and negatively related to social dominance orientation and conservatism. Thus, individuals who enjoy Energetic and Rhythmic music tend to be talkative, full of energy, are forgiving, see themselves as physically attractive, and tend to eschew conservative ideals. As one would expect for such a broad array of constructs, the magnitude of correlations varied greatly. To test the generalizabil-ity of the correlations across samples, we computed column\u2013 vector correlations for each of the four dimensions. Specifically, we transformed the correlations using Fisher\u2019s r -toz formula and then computed the correlation between the two columns of transformed correlations. As shown in the bottom row of Table 3, the pattern of correlations for each of the music dimensions was virtually iden-tical across samples; column\u2013vector correlations ranged from .851 for the Energetic and Rhythmic dimension to .977 for the Reflec-tive and Complex dimension. 5 One noteworthy finding was the absence of substantial correla-tions between the musicpreference dimensions and Emotional Stability, depression, and self-esteem, suggesting that chronic emotional states do not have a strong effect on music preferences. Within each music dimension, however, there are undoubtedly songs that capture different emotional states. Therefore, the fact that no relationship was found between music preferences and chronic emotions does not indicate that emotions are not related to 5 It should be noted that strong column\u2013vector correlations could be generated merely from the inclusion of a mixture of constructs, some of which correlate strongly and some of which correlate weakly with the music-preference dimensions. 1250 RENTFROW AND GOSLING Table 3 External Correlates of the Music-Preference Dimensions Reflective and Intense and Upbeat and Energetic and Complex Rebellious Conventional Rhythmic Criterion measure M ( SD ) S2 S3 S2 S3 S2 S3 S2 S3 Personality Big Five Extraversion 3.42(0.85) .01 .02 .00 .08* .24* .15* .22* .19* Agreeableness 3.80(0.62) .03 .04 .01 .23* .24* .08* .09* Conscientiousness 3.57(0.64) .02 .06 .03 .15* .18* .00 .03 Emotional Stability 3.11(0.81) .08* .04 .01 .01 .07 .04 .01 .01 Openness 3.75(0.61) .44* .41* .18* .15* .14* .08* .03 .04 Interpersonal dominance 1.52(0.25) .07* .06* .04 .06* .05 .04 .05 Social dominance 2.70(1.00) .16* .12* .06* .04 .06* .14* .09* .10* Blirtatiousness a 2.95(0.70) .00 .00 .01 .07* .04 .01 .08* .11* Self-esteem 3.05(0.69) .02 .02 .01 .07* .05 .06* .04 Depression 0.87(0.34) .01 .03 .03 .03 .08* .07* .02 Self-views Politically liberal 3.17(1.22) .15* .09* .03 .08* .20* .17* .07* .14* Politically conservative 2.83(1.21) .09* .03 .04 .03 .24* .23* .06* .09* Physically attractive 3.69(0.91) .00 .05 .07* .09* .15* .08* Wealthy 2.86(1.11) .04 .06 .03 .00 .08* .05 .02 .01 Athletic 3.33(1.26) .07* .08* .06* .07* .13* .12* .11* .07* Intelligent 4.22(0.71) .10* .06* .07* .08* .05* .02 .02 .01 Cognitive ability (Wonderlic) b Verbal 19.09(3.72) .19* \u2014 .19* \u2014 .18* \u2014 .01 \u2014 Analytical 6.11(2.16) .08 \u2014 .05 \u2014 .02 \u2014 .08 \u2014 Column vector correlations .977 .863 .923 .851 Note.

One possibility is that existing personality dimensions influence the musicpreference dimensions that indi-viduals generally prefer and that emotional states influence the \u201cmood\u201d of the music that individuals choose to listen to on any given day. To gain a firm grasp of the link between music pref-erences and emotions, future research should examine the emo-tional valence of the music people choose to listen to while in different emotional states. General Discussion The primary purpose of this research was to examine the land-scape of music preferences, thereby laying the groundwork for a theory of music preferences. In a series of studies, we examined lay beliefs about music, the structure underlying music prefer-ences, and the links between music preferences and personality. One goal of this research was to determine how much importance individuals give to music relative to other leisure activities. Over-all, the results from Study 1 indicate that music is at least as important as most other leisure activities. Participants believed that their music preferences revealed a substantial amount of informa-tion about their own personalities and selfviews and the personalities of other people. Furthermore, participants reported listening to music very frequently in a variety of different contexts. These latter findings converge nicely with recent work by Mehl and Pennebaker (2003), who sampled people\u2019s everyday activities and found that individuals listened to music during approximately 14% of their waking lives, roughly the same amount of time as they spent watching television and half the amount of time they spent engaged in conversations. Thus, our data support empirically what might seem selfevident to many: Music is important to people, and they listen to it frequently. Using multiple samples, methods, and geographic regions, three independent studies converged to reveal four dimensions of music preferences. The findings presented in Studies 2\u2013 4 are important because they are the first to suggest that there is a clear, robust, and meaningful structure underlying music preferences. In addition, the results from Study 5 provide valuable information about the music attributes that differentiate the musicpreference dimen-sions: The dimensions can be distinguished by their levels of complexity, emotional valence, and energy level. Although early research on music preferences suggested links between certain music genres and certain personality characteris- MUSIC PREFERENCES 1251 tics, the picture they provided was not complete. Using a broad and systematic selection of music genres and personality dimensions, the results from Study 6 cast more light on the variables that link individuals to their music of choice. Across two samples of college students, relationships between music preferences and existing personality dimensions, self-views, and cognitive abilities were identified. Developing a Theory of Music Preferences The research reported here fits into a broader agenda of devel-oping a theory of music preferences. What should be asked of such a theory? One important question pertains to the formation of music preferences. How do music preferences develop? What factors influence their development? A second question relates to the trajectory of music preferences. How, when, and why do music preferences change? A theory of music preferences should also address the impact of music on behavior. How do music prefer-ences influence behavior and how do individuals make use of music in their everyday lives? The research presented here indicates that personality, self-views, and cognitive abilities could all have roles to play in the formation and maintenance of music preferences. The results from Study 6 are consistent with the idea that personality has an impact on music preferences. Just as the social and physical environments that people select and shape reflect their personalities (Buss, 1987; Gosling et al., 2002; Snyder & Ickes, 1985), so too do their musical environments. Our findings show that, for example, pref-erence for cheerful music with vocals (the Upbeat and Conventional dimension) was positively related to Extraversion whereas preference for artistic and intricate music (e.g., the Reflective and Complex dimension) was positively related to Openness to New Experiences. Future research that includes narrower facets of per-sonality is needed to provide a finer grained picture of the effects of personality on music preferences. Music preferences also appear to be shaped by self-views. Theorists concerned with social identity and the self have pointed out that the social environments that individuals select serve to reinforce their self-views (e.g., Gosling et al., 2002; Swann, 1987, 1996; Swann et al., 2002; Tajfel & Turner, 1986), and our findings suggest that people may select music for similar reasons. This can happen in two ways. First, music preferences could be used to make self-directed identity claims (Gosling et al., 2002). That is, individuals might select styles of music that reinforce their self-views; for example, individuals may listen to esoteric music to reinforce a self-view of being sophisticated. Our findings provide evidence consistent with this idea: Individuals with a conservative self-view preferred conventional styles of music (the Upbeat and Conventional dimension), whereas individuals with an athletic self-view preferred vigorous music (the Intense and Rebellious dimension). Music can also be used to make other-directed identity claims (Gosling et al., 2002). That is, individuals might select styles of music that allow them to send a message to others about who they are or how they like to be seen; for instance, individuals who listen to heavy metal music at a loud volume with their car windows rolled down may be trying to convey a \u201ctough\u201d image to others. Evidence for other-directed identity claims has been provided by research suggesting that people use music as a badge for others to see (North & Hargreaves, 1999). Thus, music preferences may operate at different levels, both reinforcing how one sees oneself and sending messages to others. Music preferences also appear to be influenced by cognitive ability. The relationship between cognitive ability and music pref-erences is consistent with the idea that people prefer music that provides optimal levels of stimulation. Berlyne (1971, 1974) hypothesized that individuals prefer aesthetic stimuli that produce moderate amounts of stimulation to objects that produce too much or too little stimulation. Previous research on aesthetic preferences in literature and visual arts has supported this notion, and this suggests that individual differences in cognitive complexity moderate preferences for particular aesthetic stimuli. Whereas cogni-tively complex individuals tend to prefer complex aesthetic stim-uli, less cognitively complex individuals tend to prefer simple aesthetic stimuli (Barron, 1955; France`s, 1976; Kammann, 1966). The relationship between intelligence and preference for complex music supports this previous work and suggests that the optimal level of stimulation for highly intelligent individuals is produced by complex music whereas the optimal level of stimulation for less intelligent individuals is produced by comparatively simpler mu-sic. Future research that examines individual differences in cog-nitive complexity and music complexity could shed light on the possible mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of music preferences. If music preferences are partially determined by personality, self-views, and cognitive abilities, then knowing what kind of music a person likes could serve as a clue to his or her personality, self-views, and cognitive abilities. The participants in Study 1 certainly believed that knowing a person\u2019s music preferences could reveal valid information about what he or she is like. In addition, the findings from Study 6 suggest that knowing people\u2019s music preferences can provide information about their Openness, Extraversion, political orientation, and intelligence. It is also pos-sible that music preferences reveal information about other facets of personality, such as values and goals. Future research is needed to examine the role of music preferences in person\u2013perception processes. In addition to the influences of personality, selfviews and cognitive abilities, a full theory of music preferences will need to examine many other possible determinants. It seems likely that cultural and environmental influences will influence the music an individual likes. For example, individuals growing up in small rural towns in Texas will probably be exposed to a very different set of music than individuals growing up in metropolitan New York. It also seems likely that the patterns of influences will vary across the life course such that individuals may first adopt the preferences of their parents; later become influenced by their peers; and then, as they develop more autonomy, their personali-ties may play a larger role. If so, we would expect stronger links between music preferences and personality in older rather than younger participants. Thus, one important direction for future research would be tracking the trajectory of music preferences across the life course. A theory of music preferences should also be applicable across groups and contexts. Thus, one major goal is to examine the extent to which the specific structure identified in this research generalizes to other groups. Is there a similar structure underlying music preferences across different age groups? Would a similar structure 1252 RENTFROW AND GOSLING emerge in Asia, Europe, Canada, and elsewhere? New styles of music are being created all the time and in different cultures, so it is reasonable to assume that the four music-preference dimensions found here would not be found among a group of elderly people living in a remote part of Indonesia. However, even though music genres come and go, there may be a finite number of music-preference dimensions that satisfy or reflect certain psychological needs. In other words, regardless of the time period or culture, there may be a limited number of styles of music that cluster together to form Reflective and Complex, Intense and Rebellious, Upbeat and Conventional, and Energetic and Rhythmic music dimensions. Thus, even if the specific structure identified in this research is not universal, a good theory of musical preferences will be able to explain how, when, and why the structures might differ. A theory of music preferences should also explain how individ-uals make use of music. One possibility is that individuals use music as a means of regulating their emotions in everyday life. Do individuals seek out music that is consistent with their current mood or select music to change their mood? The findings from Study 6 suggest that chronic affect does not influence people\u2019s standing on any of the music-preference dimensions, but emotional states may influence the mood of the music chosen within their preferred dimension. For example, when a person high on the Reflective and Complex dimension is feeling cheerful, she may listen to jazz music that is lively, but when she is feeling sad she may choose the blues. This leads to another interesting question: Does emotional and physiological arousal influence music prefer-ences? Previous research on music preferences has suggested that arousal does play a role (McNamara & Ballard, 1999). Moreover, research linking emotional states and physiological arousal has indicated that anger tends to be associated with a high heart rate, happiness with a moderate heart rate, and depression with a low heart rate (Averill, 1969; Cacioppo, Klein, Bernston, & Hatfield, 1993; Ekman, Levenson, & Frieson, 1983). Our findings dovetail nicely with this research. Judges in Study 5 perceived angry music as highly energetic, happy music as moderately energetic, and depressing music as least energetic. One possibility is that people choose a tempo of music that is consistent with the heart rate that characterizes their current or desired mood. There is clearly a long way to go before a theory of music preferences can be articulated fully. However, the research pre-sented here has provided a foundation on which future research can build, and we have suggested just a few of the many directions that such research can take. Ultimately, we hope that research will begin to inform our understanding of music, a phenomenon that pervades many aspects of everyday life but has hitherto been virtually ignored in mainstream social and personality psychology. Conclusion It is clear to us that music can contribute much to the under-standing of many psychological phenomena. From personality and the self to social cognition and emotions, adding music to the research gamut can open a new window into people\u2019s everyday lives. To facilitate this goal, we have provided an initial map of the musicpreferences terrain and identified some potential landmarks for future exploration. More broadly, integrating facets of people\u2019s everyday lives into the research repertoire will undoubtedly cast light on important psychological processes that have remained in the shadow of mainstream topics in social and personality psychology. Music is only one of those facets. Thus, we urge social and personality psychologists to broaden their research foci to include aspects of people\u2019s daily lives and to develop an ecologically sensitive de-piction of social behavior.

The subject group consisted of 145 students, male and female, chosen at random from dif-ferent Polish universities. For the purpose of determining their personafity traits the participants completed the 16PF Questionnaire (Cattell, Saunders, & Stice, 1957; Russel & Karol, 1993), in its Polish adaptation by Choynowski (Nowakowska, 1970). The participants' musical preferences were determined by their completing a Questionnaire of Mu-sical Preferences (specifically created for the purposes of this research), in which respondents indicated their favorite piece of music. Next, on the basis of the Questionnaire of Mu-sical Preferences, a list of the works of music chosen by the participants was compiled. All pieces were collected on CDs and analyzed to separate out their basic musical elements. The statistical analysis shows that some personafity traits: Liveliness (Factor F), Social Boldness (Factor H), Vigilance (Factor L), Openness to Change (Factor Q1), Extraversion (a general factor) have an influence on preferences regarding musical elements. Important in the subjects' musical prefer-ences were found to be those musical elements having stim-ulative value and the ability to regulate the need for stimula-tion. These are: tempo, rhythm in relation to metrical basis, number of melodic themes, sound voluminosity, and meter. Malgorzata Kopacz, PhD, MT-BC, is Assistant Professor at The Department of Psy-chology, Opole University. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 217 Vol. XLII, No. 3, Fall2005 The subject of musical preferences is an unusually important one, both with regard to music therapy and for all methods and techniques in which music is employed. A knowledge of musical preferences is enormously significant in the selection of music for therapeutic work. Many studies show that music preferred by the client is comparable in its effectiveness to that chosen by the thera-pist, with regard to reduction of anxiety (Iwanaga & Moroki, 1999; Thaut & Davis, 1999). For the purposes for this article, musical preferences have been defined as \"the act of choosing, esteeming, or giving advantage to one thing over another through a verbal statement, rating scale re-sponse, or choice made from two or more alternatives\" (Kuhn, 1980). In the literature on the subject, many factors can be identi-fied as having considerable impact on musical preferences. These include personality traits (Burt, 1939; Daoussis & McKelvie, 1986; Klimas-Kuchtowa, 2000; McCown, Keiser, Mulhearn, & Williamson, 1997; Rawlings, Hodge, Sherr, & Dempsey, 1995). Research into personality-dependent musical preferences has quite a long history. Most of it is associated with Eysenck's personality di-mensions: extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism (Eysenck, 1958). Extraverts prefer usually homogenous, lively, emotional vigor-ous, sensual music, while introverts prefer intellectual, mystical, deep, introspective and restrained music (Burt, 1939; Klimas-Kuchtowa, 2000). In turn, psychoticism is significantly correlated with prefer-ences for musical complexity. People with high levels of psychoticism prefer more complicated and complex pieces than people with low levels of psychoticism (Rawlings et al., 1995). Interesting findings emerged from research conducted by McCown et al. (1997). From this, it emerges that traits such as extraversion and psychoticism are positively correlated with preferences for works of music played back with amplified bass. Other research, by Furnham, Trew, and Sneade (1999), shows that music as a means of stimulation may aid cognitive activity in extraverts and suppress cognitive activity among introverts. With the above consideration in mind, it was decided to check what relationships exist between personality traits, as classified by Cattell, and musical preferences. The choice of Cattell's theory was dictated by the fact that Cattell describes personality structure in a detailed way, separating out 16 factors. This is in accordance with the suggestions of Furman and Avison (1997), who claim that nar-rower dimensions of personality may be more useful in the study of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 218 Journal of Music Therapy artistic preferences. It is probable that the use of narrow dimensions of personality allows a more precise description of the rela-tionship between personality traits and the specific musical ele-ments that make up the works of music chosen by participants. The research into musical preferences was conducted based on the latest advances in cognitive psychology in the field of music perception (Sloboda, 1999). Currently, it is emphasized that per-ception of music is based on the perception of musical elements, and takes place in accordance with set rules (similarly to the per-ception of speech according to psycholinguistic theory). To under-stand a work of music, it must first be analyzed structurally, in ac-cordance with the rules of representation theory, common to composers, listeners and performers. In consequence, in this re-search each piece of music (as chosen by the participants) was an-alyzed, for the purpose of classifying its primary musical elements. This study is an attempt to answer two questions. First, whether people with certain personality traits prefer the certain musical ele-ments in works of music and, second, which personality\" traits have a particular influence on preferences regarding musical elements. On the basis of the considerations set out above, it may be hypothesized that some personality traits described by Cattell Warmth (A), Liveli-ness (F), Social Boldness (H), Self-Reliance (Q2), Abstractedness (M), Openness to Change (Q1), Vigilance (L), comprising the Gen-eral Extraversion Factor' will determine preferences regarding musi-cal elements. The following hypothesizes were therefore formulated: HI: Factor A has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H2: Factor F has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H3: Factor H has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H4: Factor Q2 has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H5: Factor M has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements l In the Polish adaptation the 16PF Questionnaire, 3 additional factors comprising Extraversion have been introduced: M-, QI-, L-.

Method Participants Randomly chosen students (N--- 145) in higher education in Poland participated in this study. The age range was 19-26, and the sample consisted of 85 women and 60 men. The participants de-clared that while they enjoyed listening to the music, they did not have a professional music education. The emphasis during the se-lection on the level of musical education was designed to create a group that was homogenous in terms of overall music apprecia-tion, that is, to eliminate the analytical music-listening abilities characteristic of professionally educated musicians. The partici-pants also declared that they did not identify u4th any subculture group. This is significant because music in such groups has a spe-cific role, which is outside the scope of this study. Material The 16 PF Questionnaire (Cattell et al., 1957; Russel & Karol, 1993) in the Polish adaptation by Choynowski (Nowakowska, 1970) was used in this research, as well as the Questionnaire of Musical Pref-erences (created by the author for the purposes of this research). The Questionnaire of Musical Preferences consists of instructions and a part in which the respondent writes in information regarding their favorite piece of music: title, performer, composer (in the case of classical music) and title of the recording where the work is to be found. Musical analysis employed in musicology was also used in the re-search. The musical analysis involved the isolation of basic ele-ments contained in the musical composition (Chominski & Wilkowska-Chominska, 1983; Sadie, 1980). Before beginning test-ing, nine musical elements were selected. Each of the elements was divided into several categories which, in the opinion of the author, enable an objective description of the piece of music. In the research undertaken, the musical analysis involved listen-ing to each piece chosen by the participants and assigning to it a Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 220 Journal of Music Therapy specific category for each musical element. For the purposes of the research, the following elements were isolated: 1. Tempo---measured using a metronome; howevex, in descriptions and in the interpretation of data, words describing tempo have been used, based on metronome speed: (a) quarter note < 40 (adagio), (b) quarter note = 40-60 (andante), (c) quarter note = 61-80 (moderato), (d) quarter note = 81-100 (allegretto), (e) quarter note = 101-120 (allegro), (f) quarter note > 120 (presto); 2. Changes in Tempo (acceleration or deceleration within single phrases, musical sentences or parts): (a) lack of tempo changes, (b) moderate changes (changes within a portion of the piece), (c) frequent changes (changes within musical sentences and phrases); 3. Rhythm in relation to metrical basis: (a) majority of rhythm val-ues longer than metrical basis (e.g., half note in 4/4 time), (b) majority of values similar to metrical basis (e.g., quarter note in 4/4 time), (c) majority of rhythm values shorter than metrical basis (e.g., eighth note and sixteenth note in the 4/4 time); 4. Number of Melodic Themes: (a) small--number and distribu-tion of melodic themes similar to the layout of the main part of the work (e.g., verses, refrains), (b) large--a variety of melodic themes within the work of music; 5. Sound Voluminosity (i.e., variety of instruments): (a) low--only one or two instruments, except in the case of piano, organ, gui-tar and electronic instruments (if used with a wide sound spec-trum in the piece), (b) moderate--ranging from three instru-ments playing simultaneously up to the sound spectrum characteristic of a chamber orchestra, (c) high--instruments characteristic of a symphony orchestra, the piano or guitar in full voice, and also combinations of electrical or electronic in-struments, as well as loud percussion; 6. Meter: (a) duple and quadruple rhythm, (b) triple rhythm, (d) asymmetric rhythm (e.g., 5/4, 7/4), (e) hybrid rhythm, (e) free time (lack of beat) ; 7. Sound Dynamics over the course of the piece2: (a) no changes, 2 It was not possible to objectively establish the volume level for each piece by indi-vidual participant, since the participants filled in only data associated with their fa-vorite work of music.

Melodics, in the sense of a set selection of notes, based on the total sequence adopted, that is, scale: (a) pre-modal, (b) modal, (c) chromatic major, (d) chromatic minor, (e) chromatic major and minor, (f) whole-tone scale, (g) serial dodecaphonic struc-tures; 9. Leading Instrument Timbre (this category includes those in-struments, together with the human voice, that were actually se-lected by respondents, with the result that this category arose fol-lowing the collection and analysis of the pieces)~: (a) soprano, (b) mezzo-soprano, (c) alto, (d) tenor, (e) baritone, (f) bass, (g) soprano and tenor, (h) soprano and baritone, (i) choir, (l) vio-lin, (k) piano, (1) saxophone, (m) electric guitar, (n) synthe-sizer, (o) others. As a result of this analysis, each work of music was characterized in terms of the nine element set: Tempo, Changes in Tempo, Rhythm, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity, Meter, Sound Dynamics, Melodics, Leading Instrument Timbre. Procedure This research was conducted over a one-month period at the fol-lowing Polish universities: Wroclaw University, Wroclaw Technical University, Wroclaw School of Economics, Rzeszow Technical Uni-versity. The testing was undertaken in the lecture rooms of the above academic institutions, during morning hours, by daylight. Due to the time of year (fall) and the necessity of maintaining low noise levels in the rooms, all windows were closed during testing. The lectureroom walls were white in color. Testing was carried out in groups, with each group numbering about 20 people. Those who agreed to take part in this research were informed of its pur-pose and its progress. They completed the 16 PF Questionnaire and the Questionnaire of MusicaI Preferences. After collecting the completed questionnaires, analysis of these findings was begun. Using the 16 PF Questionnaire, the personality SCreating this category before musical analysis was impossible, due to the massive number of instruments appearing in the musical literature. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 222 Journal of Music Therapy traits of the participants were determined. Next, on the basis of the Questionnaire of Musical Preferences, a complete list of works of music, consisting of 117 pieces, was compiled (a listing of the pieces is shown in Appendix 1). The pieces, collected on CDs, were musi-cally analyzed, with each piece being described in terms of the nine-element set. Results A number of statistical methods were used in the verification of the hypotheses. For the determination of correlations between per-sonality traits and musical elements, two correlation coefficients were used. These are: Spearman's 7;, for ordinal variables (for mu-sic elements: Tempo, Changes in Tempo, Rhythm, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity) and Cramer's Vfor nomi-nal variables (for music elements: Meter, Sound Dynamics, Melod-ics, Leading Instrument Timbre). Next, F-test analysis of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. The cz significance level was set at p < .05. The results of the statistical analysis are shown in Table 1. The discussion of the results is presented in a uniform format. First, the results for correlation coefficients are presented, next the variance analysis results. For those personality traits achieving sta-tistically significant values in the variance analysis, compilations of mean values are shown in chart form. The greatest number of relationships to musical elements was shown by Factor H. It achieved correlations with three elements: Tempo, Number of Melodic Themes and Meter. The q values in the case of Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes are positive, meaning that together with an increase in Factor H, preferences for musical pieces with faster tempo and a greater number of melodic themes increase. In the analysis of variance, Factor H also had relationships with three musical elements: Tempo, Number of Melodic Themes and Meter. In analyzing the compilation of mean Factor-H values for the element Tempo (see Figure 1), it is notice-able that people with the highest mean H are those choosing fast tempos in pieces of music. Further down the sequence with regard to mean H values are those choosing: Very Fast, Moderately Fast, Moderately Slow, Very Slow and Slow Tempos. Dividing absolute tempo into 3 groups: Fast Tempos (quarter note > 101), Moderate Tempos (quarter note = 61-100), Slow Tempos (quarter note < 60), it is noticeable that people choosing Fast Tempos are characterized Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 40 223 VOI.

In contrast, the r, value for Factor L is negative, mean-ing that, with increasing Factor-L values, preferences for pieces with faster tempo and greater numbers of melodic themes decrease. In other words, the greater the Factor L, the more often people prefer pieces with slower tempos and a lower number of melodic themes. However, in the analysis of variance, Factors F, Q1 and L achieved a significant statistical relationship with one musical element--Num-ber of Melodic Themes. The analysis of mean values for Factor F (see Figure 4) and Factor Q1 (see Figure 5) indicates that people characterized by a higher mean F and Q1 choose pieces with a high number of melodic themes, while conversely people with lower mean F and Q1 choose pieces with a low number of melodic themes. In contrast, the analysis of mean Factor-L values (see Figure 6) indicates that people characterized by higher mean L values choose musical pieces with low numbers of melodic themes, while those characterized by lower mean Factor-L values tend to choose musical pieces with a high number of melodic themes. Factor M achieved a statistically significant correlation with the element Sound Dynamics. However, in the analysis of variance, Factor M did not achieve any statistically significant correlations. From the tables it can also be seen that Factors A and Q2 turned out to be insignificant in the research undertaken.

      "text": "GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Several studies have looked at how people\u2019s music preference and personality are related to the sub-culture surrounding the music they like (Arnett, 1991; North & Hargreaves, 1999). Future research focusing on these different sub-cultures may lead to pertinent discoveries about how music affects individuals not only as a leisure activity but as a part of their identity and how it affects them socially. Finally, it may be useful to look at not only what music people listen to, and the different ways in which they listen to music, but finding out the reason why people enjoy listening to different types of music could also be invaluable. Practical and theoretical Implications There have been numerous studies showing that much psychological information gained by exploring a music preference. However, although the area of music in Psychology is growing, it is still chronically understudied. Seeing as how most people rate music very highly in terms of what is important to them and they believe it is something that makes up their individuality (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) and can provide valuable insights into their personality, studies such as the present one are very useful in broadening the previous literature. Music has not only been shown to be an integral part of a person\u2019s identity but also a big part in their social life as music is played in so many social situations and oftentimes people are part of subcultures that have to do with their music preference. Understanding a person\u2019s music preference on the sub-culture they are part of because of music has many practical applications for counsellors and Psychologists as it can help them gain greater insights to the personalities and social identities of their patients. Music has also been shown to have a number of useful psychological applications such as enhancing mood, emotional regulation, evoking memories and even helping people to communicate who could not do so otherwise (Barret et al, 2010; Hunter et al, 2011; Zenter et al, 2008). GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1009>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> Studies like the present one, which help to expand on previous research by showing that there is a definite correlation between the type of music a person listens to and their personality type could also be of use to the music industry as they could possibly have a more personalised approach when marketing music to people as they could use ads that appeal to certain personality types rather than basing their marketing purely on age and demographics. For example if they knew that people who were extraverts were more likely to listen to energetic and complex music, they could advertise this type of music in mediums that extraverts are more likely to come in contact with such as music festivals or large social events. Whereas if they knew that people who were open to experience were more likely to enjoy complex and reflective music, they could market it to them in a way that emphasizes how new and exciting the new music they were pushing were. This study would also be of use to social psychologists as music is clearly a social phenomenon and can be used as a pathway into a person\u2019s social attitudes and beliefs identity (North & Hargreaves, 1999 ). People tend to listen to music which is in accordance to their own views and beliefs and so knowing a person\u2019s music preferences could be useful in gaining awareness of their lifestyle patters, personal tendencies\u2019 and social identity. Many researchers believe that one of the functions of music is the consolidation of identity (Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2007). This study would also be relevant to counsellor\u2019s, teachers, parents and educational Psychologists because past research has indicated that certain types of music such as heavy metal music are linked with anti-social behaviour, anger and emotional problems(Epstein, Pratto, Skipper, 1998; et al Arnett, 1991) GLYPH<g1008>GLYPH<g1010>GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> GLYPH<g3> They also found that a preference for heavy music in adolescence was correlated with having an unhappy family life. Adolescents who prefer lighter music were more likely to be socially awkward and have problems building social relationships. Thus it may be a warning signal if a child or adolescent is listening to heavy metal or hip hop that they may have some family or emotional issues worth exploring, which could help them with their development. It might therefore be useful to learn a person\u2019s music preference which could help to give a sense of their personality profile and understand what issues they might be facing (Schwartz & Fouts, 2003 ). Finally, it is useful to learn a person\u2019s music preference as it is another tool that Psychologists can use to unlock their patients emotional cognitive needs. Conclusion This study was successful in elaborating further an area of study which is still in the early stages of development. There was a relationship found between Openness to experience and the reflective/complex, intense and rebellious and energetic and rhythmic music dimensions. There was also a relationship found between extraversion and the energetic and rhythmic music dimension. Additionally, the over 30 age group displayed a correlation between the conscientiousness personality trait and the music dimensions intense/rebellious and energetic and rhythmic. These findings suggest that there is a definite relationship between music preference and personality, but the picture is far from complete and in order to truly uncover this relationship further intensive research is required.

The subject group consisted of 145 students, male and female, chosen at random from dif-ferent Polish universities. For the purpose of determining their personafity traits the participants completed the 16PF Questionnaire (Cattell, Saunders, & Stice, 1957; Russel & Karol, 1993), in its Polish adaptation by Choynowski (Nowakowska, 1970). The participants' musical preferences were determined by their completing a Questionnaire of Mu-sical Preferences (specifically created for the purposes of this research), in which respondents indicated their favorite piece of music. Next, on the basis of the Questionnaire of Mu-sical Preferences, a list of the works of music chosen by the participants was compiled. All pieces were collected on CDs and analyzed to separate out their basic musical elements. The statistical analysis shows that some personafity traits: Liveliness (Factor F), Social Boldness (Factor H), Vigilance (Factor L), Openness to Change (Factor Q1), Extraversion (a general factor) have an influence on preferences regarding musical elements. Important in the subjects' musical prefer-ences were found to be those musical elements having stim-ulative value and the ability to regulate the need for stimula-tion. These are: tempo, rhythm in relation to metrical basis, number of melodic themes, sound voluminosity, and meter. Malgorzata Kopacz, PhD, MT-BC, is Assistant Professor at The Department of Psy-chology, Opole University. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 217 Vol. XLII, No. 3, Fall2005 The subject of musical preferences is an unusually important one, both with regard to music therapy and for all methods and techniques in which music is employed. A knowledge of musical preferences is enormously significant in the selection of music for therapeutic work. Many studies show that music preferred by the client is comparable in its effectiveness to that chosen by the thera-pist, with regard to reduction of anxiety (Iwanaga & Moroki, 1999; Thaut & Davis, 1999). For the purposes for this article, musical preferences have been defined as \"the act of choosing, esteeming, or giving advantage to one thing over another through a verbal statement, rating scale re-sponse, or choice made from two or more alternatives\" (Kuhn, 1980). In the literature on the subject, many factors can be identi-fied as having considerable impact on musical preferences. These include personality traits (Burt, 1939; Daoussis & McKelvie, 1986; Klimas-Kuchtowa, 2000; McCown, Keiser, Mulhearn, & Williamson, 1997; Rawlings, Hodge, Sherr, & Dempsey, 1995). Research into personality-dependent musical preferences has quite a long history. Most of it is associated with Eysenck's personality di-mensions: extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism (Eysenck, 1958). Extraverts prefer usually homogenous, lively, emotional vigor-ous, sensual music, while introverts prefer intellectual, mystical, deep, introspective and restrained music (Burt, 1939; Klimas-Kuchtowa, 2000). In turn, psychoticism is significantly correlated with prefer-ences for musical complexity. People with high levels of psychoticism prefer more complicated and complex pieces than people with low levels of psychoticism (Rawlings et al., 1995). Interesting findings emerged from research conducted by McCown et al. (1997). From this, it emerges that traits such as extraversion and psychoticism are positively correlated with preferences for works of music played back with amplified bass. Other research, by Furnham, Trew, and Sneade (1999), shows that music as a means of stimulation may aid cognitive activity in extraverts and suppress cognitive activity among introverts. With the above consideration in mind, it was decided to check what relationships exist between personality traits, as classified by Cattell, and musical preferences. The choice of Cattell's theory was dictated by the fact that Cattell describes personality structure in a detailed way, separating out 16 factors. This is in accordance with the suggestions of Furman and Avison (1997), who claim that nar-rower dimensions of personality may be more useful in the study of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 218 Journal of Music Therapy artistic preferences. It is probable that the use of narrow dimensions of personality allows a more precise description of the rela-tionship between personality traits and the specific musical ele-ments that make up the works of music chosen by participants. The research into musical preferences was conducted based on the latest advances in cognitive psychology in the field of music perception (Sloboda, 1999). Currently, it is emphasized that per-ception of music is based on the perception of musical elements, and takes place in accordance with set rules (similarly to the per-ception of speech according to psycholinguistic theory). To under-stand a work of music, it must first be analyzed structurally, in ac-cordance with the rules of representation theory, common to composers, listeners and performers. In consequence, in this re-search each piece of music (as chosen by the participants) was an-alyzed, for the purpose of classifying its primary musical elements. This study is an attempt to answer two questions. First, whether people with certain personality traits prefer the certain musical ele-ments in works of music and, second, which personality\" traits have a particular influence on preferences regarding musical elements. On the basis of the considerations set out above, it may be hypothesized that some personality traits described by Cattell Warmth (A), Liveli-ness (F), Social Boldness (H), Self-Reliance (Q2), Abstractedness (M), Openness to Change (Q1), Vigilance (L), comprising the Gen-eral Extraversion Factor' will determine preferences regarding musi-cal elements. The following hypothesizes were therefore formulated: HI: Factor A has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H2: Factor F has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H3: Factor H has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H4: Factor Q2 has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements H5: Factor M has an effect on preferences regarding certain musical elements l In the Polish adaptation the 16PF Questionnaire, 3 additional factors comprising Extraversion have been introduced: M-, QI-, L-.

Method Participants Randomly chosen students (N--- 145) in higher education in Poland participated in this study. The age range was 19-26, and the sample consisted of 85 women and 60 men. The participants de-clared that while they enjoyed listening to the music, they did not have a professional music education. The emphasis during the se-lection on the level of musical education was designed to create a group that was homogenous in terms of overall music apprecia-tion, that is, to eliminate the analytical music-listening abilities characteristic of professionally educated musicians. The partici-pants also declared that they did not identify u4th any subculture group. This is significant because music in such groups has a spe-cific role, which is outside the scope of this study. Material The 16 PF Questionnaire (Cattell et al., 1957; Russel & Karol, 1993) in the Polish adaptation by Choynowski (Nowakowska, 1970) was used in this research, as well as the Questionnaire of Musical Pref-erences (created by the author for the purposes of this research). The Questionnaire of Musical Preferences consists of instructions and a part in which the respondent writes in information regarding their favorite piece of music: title, performer, composer (in the case of classical music) and title of the recording where the work is to be found. Musical analysis employed in musicology was also used in the re-search. The musical analysis involved the isolation of basic ele-ments contained in the musical composition (Chominski & Wilkowska-Chominska, 1983; Sadie, 1980). Before beginning test-ing, nine musical elements were selected. Each of the elements was divided into several categories which, in the opinion of the author, enable an objective description of the piece of music. In the research undertaken, the musical analysis involved listen-ing to each piece chosen by the participants and assigning to it a Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 220 Journal of Music Therapy specific category for each musical element. For the purposes of the research, the following elements were isolated: 1. Tempo---measured using a metronome; howevex, in descriptions and in the interpretation of data, words describing tempo have been used, based on metronome speed: (a) quarter note < 40 (adagio), (b) quarter note = 40-60 (andante), (c) quarter note = 61-80 (moderato), (d) quarter note = 81-100 (allegretto), (e) quarter note = 101-120 (allegro), (f) quarter note > 120 (presto); 2. Changes in Tempo (acceleration or deceleration within single phrases, musical sentences or parts): (a) lack of tempo changes, (b) moderate changes (changes within a portion of the piece), (c) frequent changes (changes within musical sentences and phrases); 3. Rhythm in relation to metrical basis: (a) majority of rhythm val-ues longer than metrical basis (e.g., half note in 4/4 time), (b) majority of values similar to metrical basis (e.g., quarter note in 4/4 time), (c) majority of rhythm values shorter than metrical basis (e.g., eighth note and sixteenth note in the 4/4 time); 4. Number of Melodic Themes: (a) small--number and distribu-tion of melodic themes similar to the layout of the main part of the work (e.g., verses, refrains), (b) large--a variety of melodic themes within the work of music; 5. Sound Voluminosity (i.e., variety of instruments): (a) low--only one or two instruments, except in the case of piano, organ, gui-tar and electronic instruments (if used with a wide sound spec-trum in the piece), (b) moderate--ranging from three instru-ments playing simultaneously up to the sound spectrum characteristic of a chamber orchestra, (c) high--instruments characteristic of a symphony orchestra, the piano or guitar in full voice, and also combinations of electrical or electronic in-struments, as well as loud percussion; 6. Meter: (a) duple and quadruple rhythm, (b) triple rhythm, (d) asymmetric rhythm (e.g., 5/4, 7/4), (e) hybrid rhythm, (e) free time (lack of beat) ; 7. Sound Dynamics over the course of the piece2: (a) no changes, 2 It was not possible to objectively establish the volume level for each piece by indi-vidual participant, since the participants filled in only data associated with their fa-vorite work of music. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 221 Vol. XLII, No. 3, Fall 2005 (b) one volume level in some parts of the piece, with sudden changes of volume between parts, (c) gradual increases or de-creases in volume during the piece; 8. Melodics, in the sense of a set selection of notes, based on the total sequence adopted, that is, scale: (a) pre-modal, (b) modal, (c) chromatic major, (d) chromatic minor, (e) chromatic major and minor, (f) whole-tone scale, (g) serial dodecaphonic struc-tures; 9. Leading Instrument Timbre (this category includes those in-struments, together with the human voice, that were actually se-lected by respondents, with the result that this category arose fol-lowing the collection and analysis of the pieces)~: (a) soprano, (b) mezzo-soprano, (c) alto, (d) tenor, (e) baritone, (f) bass, (g) soprano and tenor, (h) soprano and baritone, (i) choir, (l) vio-lin, (k) piano, (1) saxophone, (m) electric guitar, (n) synthe-sizer, (o) others. As a result of this analysis, each work of music was characterized in terms of the nine element set: Tempo, Changes in Tempo, Rhythm, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity, Meter, Sound Dynamics, Melodics, Leading Instrument Timbre. Procedure This research was conducted over a one-month period at the fol-lowing Polish universities: Wroclaw University, Wroclaw Technical University, Wroclaw School of Economics, Rzeszow Technical Uni-versity. The testing was undertaken in the lecture rooms of the above academic institutions, during morning hours, by daylight. Due to the time of year (fall) and the necessity of maintaining low noise levels in the rooms, all windows were closed during testing. The lectureroom walls were white in color. Testing was carried out in groups, with each group numbering about 20 people. Those who agreed to take part in this research were informed of its pur-pose and its progress. They completed the 16 PF Questionnaire and the Questionnaire of MusicaI Preferences. After collecting the completed questionnaires, analysis of these findings was begun. Using the 16 PF Questionnaire, the personality SCreating this category before musical analysis was impossible, due to the massive number of instruments appearing in the musical literature. Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 222 Journal of Music Therapy traits of the participants were determined. Next, on the basis of the Questionnaire of Musical Preferences, a complete list of works of music, consisting of 117 pieces, was compiled (a listing of the pieces is shown in Appendix 1). The pieces, collected on CDs, were musi-cally analyzed, with each piece being described in terms of the nine-element set. Results A number of statistical methods were used in the verification of the hypotheses. For the determination of correlations between per-sonality traits and musical elements, two correlation coefficients were used. These are: Spearman's 7;, for ordinal variables (for mu-sic elements: Tempo, Changes in Tempo, Rhythm, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity) and Cramer's Vfor nomi-nal variables (for music elements: Meter, Sound Dynamics, Melod-ics, Leading Instrument Timbre). Next, F-test analysis of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. The cz significance level was set at p < .05. The results of the statistical analysis are shown in Table 1. The discussion of the results is presented in a uniform format. First, the results for correlation coefficients are presented, next the variance analysis results. For those personality traits achieving sta-tistically significant values in the variance analysis, compilations of mean values are shown in chart form. The greatest number of relationships to musical elements was shown by Factor H. It achieved correlations with three elements: Tempo, Number of Melodic Themes and Meter. The q values in the case of Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes are positive, meaning that together with an increase in Factor H, preferences for musical pieces with faster tempo and a greater number of melodic themes increase. In the analysis of variance, Factor H also had relationships with three musical elements: Tempo, Number of Melodic Themes and Meter. In analyzing the compilation of mean Factor-H values for the element Tempo (see Figure 1), it is notice-able that people with the highest mean H are those choosing fast tempos in pieces of music. Further down the sequence with regard to mean H values are those choosing: Very Fast, Moderately Fast, Moderately Slow, Very Slow and Slow Tempos. Dividing absolute tempo into 3 groups: Fast Tempos (quarter note > 101), Moderate Tempos (quarter note = 61-100), Slow Tempos (quarter note < 60), it is noticeable that people choosing Fast Tempos are characterized Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 40 223 VOI.

In contrast, the r, value for Factor L is negative, mean-ing that, with increasing Factor-L values, preferences for pieces with faster tempo and greater numbers of melodic themes decrease. In other words, the greater the Factor L, the more often people prefer pieces with slower tempos and a lower number of melodic themes. However, in the analysis of variance, Factors F, Q1 and L achieved a significant statistical relationship with one musical element--Num-ber of Melodic Themes. The analysis of mean values for Factor F (see Figure 4) and Factor Q1 (see Figure 5) indicates that people characterized by a higher mean F and Q1 choose pieces with a high number of melodic themes, while conversely people with lower mean F and Q1 choose pieces with a low number of melodic themes. In contrast, the analysis of mean Factor-L values (see Figure 6) indicates that people characterized by higher mean L values choose musical pieces with low numbers of melodic themes, while those characterized by lower mean Factor-L values tend to choose musical pieces with a high number of melodic themes. Factor M achieved a statistically significant correlation with the element Sound Dynamics. However, in the analysis of variance, Factor M did not achieve any statistically significant correlations. From the tables it can also be seen that Factors A and Q2 turned out to be insignificant in the research undertaken.

Means of factor L for the element Number of Melodic Themes. Finally, an analysis was performed of the relationships arising be-tween the second-order factor of Extraversion Factor (extraversion is a composite of factors analyzed above) and musical elements. It turned out that this factor achieved correlations with two musical elements: Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes. The r s values are positive, indicating that with increasing extraversion, prefer-ences for works of music with faster tempo and a higher number of melodic themes increase. In the analysis of variance, the Extraver-sion Factor also achieved relationships with two musical elements: Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes. In analyzing the compi-lation of means for the element Tempo (see Figure 7), it can be concluded that people choosing fast tempos are characterized by the highest mean for Extraversion. Further down the sequence with regard to mean values are those choosing Very Fast, Moder-ately Fast, Moderately Slow, Very Slow and Slow Tempos. Dividing Tempo into 3 groups: Fast Tempo (quarter note > 101), Moderate Tempo (quarter note = 61-100) and Slow Tempo (quarter note < 60), it is noticeable that people choosing Fast Tempos have a higher mean for Extraversion, people choosing Moderate Tempos are characterized by lower means, while those choosing Slow Tem-pos are characterized by the lowest means for Extraversion.

The results achieved for these Factors are shown in Table 2. Factor O achieved correlations with seven musical elements: Tempo, Change in Tempo, Rhythm in relation to metrical basis, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity, Meter and Melody. However, in the analysis of variance, it showed a relation-ship to five musical elements: Tempo, Rhythm in relation to metri-cal basis, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity and Meter. Factor Q3 achieved correlations with four musical elements: Tempo, Number of Melodic Themes, Sound Voluminosity and Me-ter. However, in the analysis of variance, it showed a relationship to four musical elements: Tempo, Rhythm, Number of Melodic Themes and Sound Voluminosity. Factors C and Q4, in the corre-lation coefficients and the analysis of variance, showed a relation-ship with two musical elements: Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes. Factor E achieved correlations with Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes, while in the analysis of variance it showed a re-lationship only with the element Number of Melodic Themes. Fac-tor I also achieved correlations with Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes, while in the analysis of variance showing a rela-tionship with Tempo. The remaining factors contained in the 16PF questionnaire, such as Reasoning (B) and Privateness (N), did not display statisti-cally significant relationships with the musical elements isolated in this research. Discussion In the discussion of results, only those variables that achieved sta-tistically significant values, both in terms of their correlation coef-ficients and in the analysis of variance, are taken into considera-tion. Such a treatment enables an increase in confidence with regard to the relationships occurring between personality traits and musical elements, and also enables the at least partial elimina-tion of errors due to chance or else resulting from imperfections in statistical methods. In light of the above principle, the first hypothesis--that Factor A (Warmth) influences preferences regarding certain musical ele-ments-was not supported. The second hypothesis--that Factor F (Liveliness) influences preferences regarding certain musical ele-ments-was supported. Factor F achieved a relationship with the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 233 Vol. XLII, No. 3, Fall 2005 musical element Number of Melodic Themes. People with higher F values (carefree, enthusiastic, spontaneous, energetic) choose works of music with higher numbers of melodic themes than those with lower F values (serious, quiet, reflective). The third hypothesis that Factor H (Social Boldness) influences preferences regarding certain musical elements--was supported. Factor H achieved rela-tionships with the following musical elements: Tempo, Number of Melodic Themes and Meter. The results show that people with higher H values (socially bold, outgoing, gregarious, adventure-some) prefer faster tempos, a greater number of melodic themes and also irregular meters (asymmetric or in free time) in pieces of music. Conversely, people with lower H values (shy, socially timid, threat-sensitive, easily embarrassed) prefer pieces with slower tem-pos, fewer melodic themes and more regular meters (duple, quadruple, triple rhythms). The fourth and fifth hypotheses that Factors Q2 (Self-Reliance) and M (Abstractedness) influence pref-erences regarding specific musical elements were not supported. The sixth hypothesis--that Factor Q1 (Openness to Change) in-fluences preferences regarding certain musical elements--was sup-ported. Factor Q1 achieved a relationship with the element Num-ber of Melodic Themes. The results show that people with higher Q1 values (open to change, experimenting, freethinking) prefer a greater number of melodic themes in works of music, compared to people with lower results on that scale (traditional, attached to the familiar, resistant to change). The seventh hypothesis--that Factor L (Vigilance) influences preferences regarding certain musical el-ements-was supported. Factor L also displayed a relationship with the element Number of Melodic Themes. People with higher L val-ues (vigilant, suspicious, distrustful) prefer musical pieces having a lower number of melodic themes than do people with higher val-ues on that scale (trusting, unsuspecting, forgiving, accepting). Further, analysis of the second-order factor of Extraversion showed that this factor demonstrated a relationship with two musical ele-ments: Tempo and Number of Melodic Themes. In works of music, extraverted people prefer faster tempos and greater numbers of melodic themes than do introverted people. Summing up, it should be emphasized that personality traits ex-ist that have effect on preferences regarding certain elements in works of music. The greatest influence has been shown in the case of Factor O (5 mtrsical elements), followed by Factors H and Q3 (3 mu- Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jmt/article-abstract/42/3/216/873070 by guest on 04 February 2020 234 Journal of Music Therapy sical elements), Factor C, Q4 and General Extraversion Factor (2 mu-sical elements), and Factors E, E 1, L, Q1 (1 musical element each). It is worth noting that the greatest effect on preferences regard-ing musical elements is shown by personality traits associated with temperament (Factors C, E, F, H, I, L, O, Q3, Q4, General Extraver-sion Factor) and by one dynamic trait (Factor Q1) (Cattell, 1950; Cattell et al., 1957). These results are in accordance with the studies mentioned at the beginning of this article. They show that some temperament traits (extraversion and introversion) have a signifi-cant effect on musical preferences (Burt, 1939; Klimas-Kuchtowa, 2000; McCown et al., 1997), and on the manner of music usage in everyday life (Furnham et al., 1999). Significance in musical preferences was demonstrated by those elements having stimulative value and the ability to regulate the need for stimulation. These elements are: Number of Melodic Themes, Tempo, Meter, Rhythm, Sound Voluminosity. However, the musical elements: Changes in Tempo, Sound Dynamics, Melodics, Leading Instrument Timbre, were not shown to be sig-nificant by this research. It may be that these elements differentiate musical preferences for a range of other personality traits, not cov-ered by this study. The above results admit the presumption that the works of music chosen by participants are combinations of stimuli that supply them with an appropriate dose of stimulation, allowing them to function in the environment. In conclusion, it should be emphasized that the findings of this study have practical application in all techniques and methods em-ploying music for the therapeutic purposes. It is also possible to draw some important conclusions from the above research: 1. In choosing music for therapeutic purposes, one should take into account individual differences connected with tempera-ment traits, and most particularly with the need for stimulation. Ignoring such differences could have contrary effects, unin-tended by the therapist. Exceeding the optimal dose for musical stimulation or lack thereof can produce symptoms of stress. Mu-sic with a high stimulative value, as preferred by extraverts, may lead to stress in introverts. On the other hand, music with low stimulative value, as preferred by introverts, may be a source of stress for extraverts. 2.
